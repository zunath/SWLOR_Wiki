<p>Often, but not always, a major way in which a character develops over time is through what rank they hold with their particular faction. A Jedi will start as an Initiate, eventually working their way up to Knighthood. A grunt trooper may start off as a private fresh out of bootcamp, eventually winding up in a command position. Or some up and coming Czerka associate may land enough sales to find themselves in a management position.</p>
<p>To help facilitate this manner of growth, players are permitted to, with DM oversight, promote one another.</p>
<h2>Rank Structure</h2>
<p>The first thing to note is that each faction has particular tiers. These are Enlisted, NCO, Officer, and Command. Many factions, in particular the Republic and Imperial militaries, will have multiple ranks within these tiers. Others may have only one.</p>

<p>Most characters will, over time, gravitate toward Tiers 1 and 2 as you remain active and engaged with your faction. A Command (T3) position, however, will be rare, and should be considered a major accomplishment. The DM team will only grant such a position to a player who is doing phenomenal work on behalf of not only their faction but the server as a whole to bring life to the server and enrich it overall for everyone, friend and foe alike.</p>
<p>To learn more about the different ranks, please see the <a href=" https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vfy2soWcqUM5L38pzN2qmq5EiX5OVhz7enuRnmVKxAY/edit?usp=sharing">this link</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Promotion Rules</h2>
<p>A character must have been an official member of a faction for 1 full week before they can be promoted by a player. (A DM can overrule this if they see fit.)</p>
<p>A character cannot be promoted more than once in a week.</p>
<p>They cannot ascend by more than one rank per week.</p>
<p>Revanites can only reach Officer rank through the Convocation.</p>
<p>Jedi must complete their 5 Knight Trials before they are eligible to be knighted. These are normally administered (or recognized) by their Master. While several of these can be completed at once, or simply recognized as having been completed after the fact of some undertaking, it's intended to take approximately 2 months <i><strong><u>at minimum</u></strong></i> to reach Knight rank once taken as a Padawan.</p>
<p>It is mandatory that all promotions be approved by the DM team via a ticket prior to it being carried out. This ensures we can update our own roster so that it is properly recognized. This includes taking Padawans, there's advantages with the Mastery system to them achieving these ranks.</p>
<p>You can promote characters up to the highest rank in the preceding tier. A Republic Ensign can promote people up to Sergeant Major and Midshipman. A Knight can promote people up to Padawan (assuming they take them as a Padawan). A Sergeant Major can promote people up to Corporal and Petty Officer.</p>
<p>Some factions have splits between Navy and Army. The DM team is not concerned about the realism of this. A Navy Ensign in the Republic can usually promote a Master Sergeant up to Sergeant Major.</p>
<h2>Commendations</h2>
<p>Lower ranked players are encouraged to commend their leadership. Making a note of who is doing a good job and why you think they're doing a good job as commanders will help us know who may be worthy of ascending to a higher tier.</p>
<p>There is also the option to nominate people for honors. The DM team wishes to start, over time, rolling out a few medals and other awards to players for heroic behavior. For Officers in particular where we may not be interested in granting Command status, these will be a major source of recognition from their faction for their efforts. If you have an idea for a medal or other award you feel someone is worthy of, let us know so we can at least note it down on our roster, and possibly provide an actual item for it. The more creative the medal, the better!</p>
