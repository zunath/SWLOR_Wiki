<p><strong>Mon Cala</strong>, also known as <strong>Mon Calamari</strong> or <strong>Dac</strong>, was an oceanic planet located in the Mon Calamari system, a binary star system positioned in the Calamari sector of the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories and The Slice. It held a single moon in its orbit</p>

<p><span class="text-big"><i><strong><u>Description</u></strong></i></span><br><br>The oceans of Mon Cala held an abundance of life, including two influential sentient species the Mon Calamari and the Quarren. Both species prefered to build their cities underwater, but there also existed some cities built on the surface of the water. The planet was ruled by a single monarch. Despite their differences, the two peoples had generally shown mutual respect throughout their history.</p>
<p>Coral grew in large colonies on Mon Cala, with their hard skeletons forming coral reefs that acted as shelter and feeding and breeding grounds for various species of fish, crustaceans, and other sea life. The coral tended to thrive in areas bathed in the light of Mon Cala's twin suns, but some hardier species dwelt out of the light deep below the surface. In these deep sea beds of limited light, bioluminescence was a common trait for plants.</p>
<p>Although sparce, small islands dotted the surface of Mon Cala, with many of these islands forming achipelagos. The terrain of these islands ranged from rocky cliffs, to sandy beaches with dense jungle. The polar regions were colder then the rest of the planet with ice floes located in the north. Some Quarren and Mon Calamari left their homeworld to avoid its politics, instead settling the moon of Trask.</p>
<p><span class="text-big"><i><strong><sup><u>More tidbits:</u></sup></strong></i></span><br>Mon Cala was known for its shipbuilding industry, which produced beautiful and unique starships for various purposes such as pleasure cruises and deep-space exploration. The Mon Calamari ran the Mon Calamari Shipyards company, and the Quarren ran the Free Dac Volunteers Engineering Corps</p>
