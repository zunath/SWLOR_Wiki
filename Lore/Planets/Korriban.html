<h3>History</h3>
<p>Korriban was the ancestral homeworld of the Sith species and a sacred place for the Sith Order. It was a desolate, red-dusty planet, mountainous and inhospitable, yet it served as the origin of a powerful Sith civilization. The planet is known for housing the tombs of ancient Sith Lords and the Valley of the Dark Lords, a sacred area for the Sith.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The staging point of the Dark Lord of the Sith Naga Sadow in his war against the Galactic Republic and the Jedi in the year 5000, After a failed attempt at crippling the Republic's capital world of Coruscant, the retreating Sith Forces were annihilated at the culmination of the Great Hyperspace War. The native species of the Sith is said to have become extinct after this final battle, aside from the Massassi Warriors, remnants of Naga Sadow's armies he had taken with him into exile on Yavin IV.&nbsp;<br><br>In the year 3997 Exar Kun, guided by the ghost of Freedon Nadd, went to Korriban in search of knowledge about the Sith. During the Great Sith War, disciples of Exar Kun established a Sith Academy on Korriban. After Kun's death, his disciples maintained the academy and established the settlement of Dreshdae. In year 3993, as part of the Great Hunt, Duron Qel-Droma and Shaela Nuur died on the planet, failing to cleanse it of terentateks. The planet became the sector headquarters of the Czerka Corporation during the Jedi Civil War.</p>
<p>After the destruction of Malak's Sith Empire, Korriban again became the seat of power for the current reigning Dark Council.</p>
