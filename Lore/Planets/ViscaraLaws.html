<h1>Viscaran Laws and Jurisdiction</h1>
<p>Viscara is a land of many inhospitable elements but a bounty of resources ripe for the taking. Having discovered this during their planetary scouting, the Czerka Corporation quickly moved to buy the rights to the otherwise deserted planet of Viscara from the Republic. Giving themselves exclusive access to the planet and its resources, Czerka nonetheless was forced to abide by common Republic law in its enforcement of Viscara. So long as they do, Viscara is rightfully governed by Czerka and Czerka alone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The City of Veles is the largest settlement on Viscara, and is financed by the Czerka Corporation. However, it is given a degree of autonomy through its city council. The city council is made up of elected representatives voted into office by citizens of Veles. The council always contains at least one Czerka Representative, and agree to follow "Viscaran Law" as decreed by the Czerka Corporation. As with most other Republic worlds, they have a senator to represent them on the galactic stage. The City of Veles also contains a Sheriff's Office, separate from the Czerka Rangers. This law enforcement agency is also run by an elected official. Both the Czerka Rangers and Sheriff's Office are expected to work together, though where as the Rangers authority widens to Viscara itself, the Sheriff's Office only holds power within Veles itself.</p>
<p>As a company owned town on a company owned planet, there is a degree of conflict between the company and the people who live on Viscara. The council ostensibly represents the democratic will of the people, though their ability and will to resist Czerka's dictates has its limits.</p>
<h2>General Republic System Law</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Treason against the Republic carries with it harsh sentences including life imprisonment or potential execution. Acts considered treason include: knowingly aiding and abetting an enemy faction or nation (such as the Sith Empire), selling or leaking classified Republic information, aiding in the destabilization of a region or government recognized by the Republic and so on.</li>
  <li>Slavery is outlawed, and no faction or government is to enable the practice. Slaves who step foot on Republic soil are to be freed. Slavery collars and other slaving tools are to be dismantled and destroyed.</li>
  <li>To be found in possession of illegally modified weaponry, or illegal weapons such as disruptor rifles and blasters, carries with it a prison sentence and the immediate destruction of those weapons. To be caught selling such weaponry carries an even harsher sentence.</li>
  <li>Droids must be fitted with a restraining bolt, and are ineligible for citizenship and similar protections. Crimes against them are treated as crimes against their owner's property.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Bounty Hunters seeking to operate in Republic space are to be licensed through either the Bounty Hunters Guild or through another recognized venue (a venue can be recognized with the proper forms and a brief inspection)</li>
  <li>Among the list of recognized republic war crimes are: Killing a surrendered enemy, firing upon civilian targets (knowingly, intentionally, or through wanton negligence), falsely surrendering or offering terms of peace, the utilization of outlawed weaponry, the utilization of barbaric tactics ("starving out" the enemy, laying landmines around civilian infrastructure, false flag tactics, so on), and all forms of genocide.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Viscaran Law:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The Sheriff's Office and Czerka Rangers are the recognized law enforcement agencies of Viscara and Veles. The former enforce laws only within Veles's jurisdiction, while the latter enforce Viscaran laws across all of Viscara.</li>
  <li>Czerka holds the right to demand restitution for property damage and laws violated, in the form of enforced prison labor. Per Republic law, this is not considered slavery.</li>
  <li>The Czerka Corporation reserves the right to "lease out" land as it pleases and rescind their lease at any time. The exception to this is Outpost Hope, which per the terms of the purchasing of Viscara will require the local Senator's approval and that of one Rear Admiral or higher to be moved or removed.</li>
  <li>The Sith Empire is considered a hostile force, per Republic law, and acting Imperial agents are to be arrested on identification.</li>
  <li>Veles and Viscara do not discriminate based on religion or culture, so long as these things do not violate Republic Law. As such while association with the Sith Empire is considered an arrestable offense, being a "Dark Acolyte" "Dark Jedi" or general practitioner of the so called "Dark Side" and "Sith Religion" is not. However Veles reserves the right to ban anyone from the city who has become a threat to stability.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Outpost Hopes Rights and Powers</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Outpost Hope (and the Republic as a whole, by extension) reserves the right to transfer prisoners of war or persons of interest from Veles Jail to Outpost Hope.</li>
  <li>Outpost Hope may detain criminals and lawbreakers outside of Veles, though non vital prisoners should be moved to the city of itself.</li>
  <li>Outpost Hope acknowledges Veles law enforcement, and shall not interfere with Czerka Ranger (or Sheriff Office) investigations without good reason. Outpost Hope may be called upon to aid in enforcement, riot control and other matters at the governments request, which Outpost Hope may refuse depending on the circumstances.</li>
  <li>Outpost Hope and the land it sits on may not be taxed or otherwise charged for residence. However Outpost Hope is liable for any laws broken by its personnel and fines can be issued to the Republic as a whole.</li>
  <li>Outpost Hope is given free access to the Space Station above of Viscara for ship repairs, refueling and other such matters. The Republic reserves the right to use station in the event of an emergency (for example an invasion) but must return control as soon as the threat has passed. Unnecessary or avoidable damage to the station is to be repaid by the Republic.</li>
  <li>Outpost Hope is never to place military assets without approval within the walls of Veles.</li>
  <li>Republic personnel using the Veles starport are expected to comply with Veles customs and inspections. High value cargo or otherwise sensitive documents are to be brought to Outpost Hope via its own hangar, never public starports.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Jedi Orders Rights and Powers</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The Jedi Order per agreement with Veles reserves the right to confiscate any found goods that belong to the Jedi Order: former order sabers, holocrons, relics and so on. Viscaran authorities are expected to turn such found items over to the Enclave.</li>
  <li>The Jedi Order may, with Republic approval, request the transfer of a Sith prisoner to be rehabilitated. This may be denied by the Republic, which will require escalation to higher authority within the Navy.</li>
  <li>The Jedi Order are recognized as governors of Aerlson's Rest. Both the Viscaran Enclave, and the Rest, are still considered Czerka land. Taxes for the Order are waived, but the right to the land may, should agreements break down, be reclaimed by Czerka.</li>
  <li>Rest citizens are considered Viscaran citizens, bound to all laws of Viscara and the Republic, but also given the same rights.</li>
  <li>The Jedi Order recognizes the authority of Law Enforcement. Czerka Rangers have the right to search the Jedi Grounds, exterior of the Enclave, and the Rest as a whole. However due to large amounts of sensitive or secret information kept within the Enclave, the Rangers require consent to enter the interior of the Enclave.</li>
  <li>The Jedi Order is, per agreements with the City of Veles, not to harbor fugitives within the Enclave. In the event of a legal disagreement, the Jedi may petition the Republic and Veles for a joint trial or otherwise meeting.</li>
  <li>The Jedi Order may enforce who can and cannot enter their grounds, outside of the above mentioned law enforcement.</li>
  <li>Recognized Jedi may, with the blessing of the Sheriff's Office or the Rangers, be temporarily deputized to aid in the enforcement of laws and ongoing investigations.</li>
  <li>Jedi may detain criminals and lawbreakers outside of Veles, though non vital prisoners should be moved to the city of itself.</li>
</ul>
