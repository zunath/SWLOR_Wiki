<p>To join a faction in the <a href="https://discord.gg/swlor">Star Wars: Legends of the Old Republic Discord server</a>, use ‘?rank Faction -’ followed by the exact name of the faction above. &nbsp;Refer to the <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/484936923341651971/484945166960951297/799456335058042950">Discord Faction Listing</a> for specific examples of all factions. &nbsp;Players should only join these faction channels if they have a character in the faction or they have a good faith intention to create a character and join that faction. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Players may create their own player faction if they wish. &nbsp;This requires a minimum of 5 interested players. &nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/channels/484936923341651971/930228689000603708">Open a ticket in the Discord server</a>, provide the Discord and PC names of each member, provide a faction description and come up with a name for the faction (please nothing vague like 'The Mandalorians').</p>
