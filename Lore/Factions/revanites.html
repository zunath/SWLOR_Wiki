<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>FACTION DISBANDED [2024/09]</strong></p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Order of Revan is a splinter faction of Malak’s Sith Empire. After Revan’s fall, they are those who took issue with Malak’s new, more destructive war, and threw in with Lord Valerius, supporting his rebellion against the Darth and bid to claim the title of Dark Lord of the Sith. For some their loyalty is to Valerius, others to their idea of who Revan was and what he stood for, others simply take issue with Darth Malak, and some still seek out the Revanites for their less despicable tendencies as far as Sith go, seeing them more as the Jedi Crusaders of the late Mandalorian Wars than the monsters that compose the Sith Empire. Regardless, they are still followers of the Dark Side.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, while they boast many of the finer members of Darth Revan’s Empire, including several Sith Lords and a number of elite honor guards, as well as a growing fleet, the Revanites are few in number. Numbering at less than 20,000, they lack the forces necessary to be more than a prominent local force in Mytaranor Sector. The Revanites are known to have a small fleet in orbit of Viscara’s moon, Esria.</p>
<hr>
<p>Near the end of the war with Malak, leadership of the Order was taken by Lord Lin-Harik, who eventually claimed the title of Darth and sought to bring the rest of the Revanite council of lords under his rule. They complied, but only while waiting for an opportunity to resist his influence. From the very beginning, Lord Arrelac worked against him, secretly gathering support.</p>
<p>When rumors spread across the galaxy that Revan was still alive, the rift among the Revanites deepened, as only a few were aware of the truth.</p>
<p>When Darth Lin-Harik openly opposed Revan and scorned his legacy, Sith Overseers aligned with Arrelac decided to act. Initially, they sought to uphold Revan's ideology within the Order, but over time, their efforts turned into open rebellion—one they had to lead themselves, with Arrelac imprisoned deep within Lin-Harik’s dungeons. After prolonged negotiations with other Revanites, including both Force-users and standard officers, they recognized the flaws in their previous approach and agreed that change was necessary.</p>
<p>Following a long political struggle, they managed to break away from the Order of Revan, retaining a portion of its resources, including Lake Base on Viscara and the Irluuk-class cruiser <i>Endo’s Legacy</i>. Arrelac was freed, and with his guidance and blessing, the Legion was founded. Those who remained on Viscara renounced the ways of the Sith and established a Private Military Company, operating within local laws. Meanwhile, those who stayed with Lin-Harik were exiled from Viscara and fled to Korriban, where they joined Malak in his final days of the war. After Malak’s fall, they remained on Korriban under the rule of a Council of Darths.</p>
