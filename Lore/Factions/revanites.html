<p>The Revanites are a splinter faction of Malak’s Sith Empire. After Revan’s fall, they are those who took issue with Malak’s new, more destructive war, and threw in with Lord Valerius, supporting his rebellion against the Darth and bid to claim the title of Dark Lord of the Sith. For some their loyalty is to Valerius, others to their idea of who Revan was and what he stood for, others simply take issue with Darth Malak, and some still seek out the Revanites for their less despicable tendencies as far as Sith go, seeing them more as the Jedi Crusaders of the late Mandalorian Wars than the monsters that compose the Sith Empire. Regardless, they are still followers of the Dark Side.</p>
<p>However, while they boast many of the finer members of Darth Revan’s Empire, including several Sith Lords and a number of elite honor guards, as well as a growing fleet, the Revanites are few in number. Numbering at less than 20,000, they lack the forces necessary to be more than a prominent local force in Mytaranor Sector.</p>
<p>The Revanites are known to have a small fleet in orbit of Viscara’s moon, Esria.</p>
