<p><strong>FACTION DISBANDED [2024/09]</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>The Order of Revan is a splinter faction of Malak’s Sith Empire. After Revan’s fall, they are those who took issue with Malak’s new, more destructive war, and threw in with Lord Valerius, supporting his rebellion against the Darth and bid to claim the title of Dark Lord of the Sith. For some their loyalty is to Valerius, others to their idea of who Revan was and what he stood for, others simply take issue with Darth Malak, and some still seek out the Revanites for their less despicable tendencies as far as Sith go, seeing them more as the Jedi Crusaders of the late Mandalorian Wars than the monsters that compose the Sith Empire. Regardless, they are still followers of the Dark Side.</p>
<p>However, while they boast many of the finer members of Darth Revan’s Empire, including several Sith Lords and a number of elite honor guards, as well as a growing fleet, the Revanites are few in number. Numbering at less than 20,000, they lack the forces necessary to be more than a prominent local force in Mytaranor Sector. The Revanites are known to have a small fleet in orbit of Viscara’s moon, Esria.</p>

<p>Near the end of the war with Malak, leadership over the Order has been taken by Lord Lin-Harik, which in time took a title of a Darth and tried to make the rest of the revanite council of lords obey him. They fell in line, waiting for an opportunity to fight off Darth's influence. Lord Arrelac worked in against him from the very begining, gathering support in secret. When rumors about Revan still being alive spread across the Galaxy, rift between revanites only deepened, as only few of them was aware of that secret. When Darth Lin-Harik made a stand against Revan and and scorned his legacy, Sith Overseers aligned with Arrelac decided to respond. At first they tried to sustain Revan's ideology in the Order but with time it became an open rebellion that they had to lead themselves, with Arrelac locked deep inside Lin-Haric's dungeon. After long negotiations with other revanites, both force-users and standard officers, they decided a change of ways is needed. They saw flaws in their previous approach. After a long political struggle, they managed to separate from The Order of Revan, keeping part of their resources, including Lake Base on Viscara and Irluuk Cruiser Endo's Legacy.&nbsp;</p>
