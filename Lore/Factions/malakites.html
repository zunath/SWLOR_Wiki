<p>Malak’s Sith Empire is a behemoth entity, rapidly spreading through Republic space. Among their number are the most vile of murderers and sadists, and even former heroes of the Republic. In their bid to control the galaxy, they have shown no remorse at the enslavement and even destruction of whole colonies and settlements. Further, they seem to have an endless supply of ships, droids and other resources coming in from somewhere deep in their space.</p>
<p>The Sith Empire has a number of training grounds, most notably Korriban. In such academies, aspirants to the Sith Order are made to both war against each other and compete in vicious trials for the right to ascend as proper Acolytes of the Order. Even the rank and file soldiers are not exempt from such practices, as competition and the brutal tendencies of the Sith permeate through the ranks of the Empire.</p>
<p><i>Please note: NO ONE knows about the Star Forge. No one. Only Malak and his inner circle know of it. Nor do you know where it is or where it might be. You don’t even know it exists.</i></p>
