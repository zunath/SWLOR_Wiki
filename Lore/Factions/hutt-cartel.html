<p>The Hutt clans maintain a powerful organization in the Outer Rim. &nbsp;Internally, it is owned and controlled as the Hutt Empire. &nbsp;Outside of their borders, members and operatives work as part of the Hutt Cartel. &nbsp;Extravagantly wealthy and avaricious, these gangsters engage in everything from bribery and drug smuggling to piracy, assassination, slavery and even raiding and invasion of Republic space.</p>
<p>However, this Empire is not focused on expansion into the Republic or war against it, instead contenting themselves with conflicts between the clans, extracting as much wealth as possible from their citizenry, and pressuring independent systems near them for tribute or loyalty.</p>
<p>Their capital is at Nal Hutta, though the Hutts have major holdings throughout Hutt Space, including Tatooine.</p>
