<p><i>Forged from the broken remains of Darth Malak's Sith Empire by a cadre of Dark Lords, The Sith Empire; also known by their enemies as the Sith Remnant have once more taken up the graveyard world of Korriban as their seat of Power, consolidating their forces amidst the Sith Regions of the Tingel Arm. Despite infighting and rival warlords being a near constant thorn in their sides, the Sith Empire lives on, guided by a sinister Dark Council who rule the Empire with an iron fist. These powerful Dark Lords of the Sith may unite toward the common goal of domination of the galaxy, but they have their own agendas. Infighting and power struggles are the norm as the Sith fight for the ultimate prize; Survival of the Fittest.</i></p>
<p><i>With a burgeoning Empire, protected by their Navy and informed by their Intelligence branch, the Sith Empire is a force to be reckoned with. Their forces are spread amongst their various territories; Ziost, Tund, Rhelg, and of course Korriban, the Dark Council's seat of power. Of recent, the Sith Empire has begun consolidating territories within the Viscaran Sub-Sector, to what nefarious end, who can truly say?</i></p>
