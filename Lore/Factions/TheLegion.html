<p style="text-align:justify;">The Legion was founded after the Viscaran <a href="/Lore/Factions/revanites">Order of Revan rebelled</a> against its main body, forsaking their old ways and religion in search of a new way of life.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Currently The Legion's main base of operation is Lake Base on Viscara with an ex-imperial refugee camp adjacent to it. A secured Research Center was established in the second biggest city of Talsion Prime. Legion posseses a small fleet of a cruiser, frigte and few corvettes, in majority kept on the Viscaran orbit. Additionally small groups of legionnaires are scattered around the system, working on a various types of contracts.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="text-huge"><strong>THE LEGION HANDBOOK</strong></span><br>[to be updated]</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Legion is a PMC, which stands for Private Military Company. It is intended to be a neutral faction stationed on Viscara, living and building alongside the Republic while abiding by their laws, yet not truly being a part of it. The days of pointless aggravation toward other factions are over. It’s time to mend bridges and break away from the shadow of the past. In the long term, the Legion aims to create a safe haven for those who were part of the Empire out of fear or coercion, as well as for those simply seeking a new path in life—something that is neither the Republic nor the Empire. A place of order, discipline, and unity. Starting gradually, by harboring freed slaves and prisoners, the Legion will work toward establishing a real town, focusing on changing at least part of Viscara, as changing the Galaxy itself is beyond the Legion's reach.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above represents the core idea of the Legion. To achieve any of this, the faction needs both resources and people to utilize them. This means the Legion is not just a mercenary group in name; it has to work for every credit. The goal is to train their small army to the highest standards, winning with quality over quantity. They will fight for those who may become part of the Legion or seek protection under their banner, and take on jobs that align with their principles—fighting the Imperial Remnants, but not the Republic or the Jedi Order.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Legion has a single chain of command—there are no army, military or intelligence branches as other factions tend to have. It is a faction small enough to avoid such divisions. Instead, roles are grouped into sectors for gameplay convenience <i>(more in Jobs &amp; Roles, available in faction discord channel)</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All legionnaires hold equal status within the same rank, whether they are standard characters or force-sensitives. Bullying within the Legion is strongly discouraged, and being force-sensitive will not protect anyone from consequences of their actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The structure is divided into five influence levels, which determine general intel clearance. The descriptions are kept short and simple to avoid unnecessary complexity. It’s important to use reason when handling data found on Discord or through other OOC means.</p>
<ol>
  <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Recruitment:</strong> This level is for recruits, who remain at this rank for only one week. It allows new players to get to know other players and their characters, while giving existing members a chance to assess the recruit's background. It serves as a tool to ensure the faction is a good fit for them.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Outer Circle</strong>: This level is primarily for enlisted members and the first officer rank. They are only privy to basic information—no secrets, no sensitive data—ensuring that any leaks cannot seriously harm the Legion.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Inner Circle</strong>: This level is reserved for experienced officers and top enlisted veterans. They have access to critical information relevant to their position and role within the Legion, though they cannot access all sensitive data.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>War Council</strong>: This level is exclusively for captains, the highest position players can achieve in the Legion. They are privy to most of the Legion’s secrets and oversee the faction's operations, essentially acting as the faction's leadership on the player side.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>High Council [NPC]</strong>: This council leads the Legion and advises the leader, the Legate.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Promotions within the Outer Circle can be managed by players, preferably with War Council approval. All ranks above the Outer Circle require approval from the High Council, and by extension, from DMs.</p>
