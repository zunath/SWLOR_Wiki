<p style="text-align:justify;">The Legion was founded after a viscaran Order of Revan rebelled against it's main body and forsaken their old ways and religion to find a new way of life.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Legion is a PMC, which stands for Private Military Company. It is intended to be a neutral faction stationed on Viscara, living and building alongside the Republic while abiding by their laws, yet not truly being a part of it. The days of pointless aggravation toward other factions are over. It’s time to mend bridges and break away from the shadow of the past. In the long term, the Legion aims to create a safe haven for those who were part of the Empire out of fear or coercion, as well as for those simply seeking a new path in life—something that is neither the Republic nor the Empire. A place of order, discipline, and unity. Starting gradually, by harboring freed slaves and prisoners, the Legion will work toward establishing a real town, focusing on changing at least part of Viscara, as changing the Galaxy itself is beyond the Legion's reach.</p>
