<p>The Legion was founded after the Viscaran <a href="/Lore/Factions/revanites">Order of Revan rebelled</a> against its main body, forsaking their old ways and religion in search of a new way of life.</p>

<hr>
<p>The Legion is a PMC, which stands for Private Military Company. It is intended to be a neutral faction stationed on Viscara, living and building alongside the Republic while abiding by their laws, yet not truly being a part of it. The days of pointless aggravation toward other factions are over. It’s time to mend bridges and break away from the shadow of the past. In the long term, the Legion aims to create a safe haven for those who were part of the Empire out of fear or coercion, as well as for those simply seeking a new path in life—something that is neither the Republic nor the Empire. A place of order, discipline, and unity. Starting gradually, by harboring freed slaves and prisoners, the Legion will work toward establishing a real town, focusing on changing at least part of Viscara, as changing the Galaxy itself is beyond the Legion's reach.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above represents the core idea of the Legion. To achieve any of this, the faction needs both resources and people to utilize them. This means the Legion is not just a mercenary group in name; it has to work for every credit. The goal is to train their small army to the highest standards, winning with quality over quantity. They will fight for those who may become part of the Legion or seek protection under their banner, and take on jobs that align with their principles—fighting the Imperial Remnants, but not the Republic or the Jedi Order.</p>
