<p>The Navy is the brave protectors of the Galaxy, widely loved by the denizens of the Republic for their steadfast and selfless defense. The Navy however is reeling from the recent and massive betrayal of Darth Revan and vast swathes of their battlefleet, which led to the formation of Revan’s Sith Empire (which is now Malak’s Sith Empire).</p>
<p>Despite this massive loss of fleet- and man-power, the Republic is by far the dominant force in the galaxy, though it is spread thin across much territory, and has consolidated most of its resources at critical, high population worlds such as Taris, Coruscant and Mon Cal. Most Republic worlds see only frequent patrols by roving frigates and corvettes, in some cases (such as Viscara) being lucky enough to have the dedicated protection of a cruiser.</p>
<p>This has led to many mistakenly believing the Republic is weak and defenseless, but anyone visiting a sector capital, fortress world or other critical asset of the Republic would be greeted with a massive battlefleet capable of launching devastating attacks on anyone who would threaten it.</p>
<p>At present, the Republic is chiefly concerned with halting the Sith Empire’s unrelenting advance through the Outer and Mid Rim sectors before they can reach the Core Worlds, at which point they would have a clear shot at claiming control of the entire galaxy.</p>
