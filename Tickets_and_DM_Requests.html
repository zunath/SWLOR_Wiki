<h1>Tickets and DM Requests</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In Star Wars Legends of the Old Republic (SWLOR), tickets are a key tool for player interaction. This system establishes a structured channel for dialogue between players and the Dungeon Master (DM) or Quest Master (QM), and caters to a multitude of game-enhancing requests.</p>
<p>Tickets offer a structured and efficient approach for players to express their unique needs and requests, allowing them to tailor their gameplay experience more closely to their character's narrative arc. The scope of tickets ranges from personalized item requests to event organization, reflecting the diverse needs of the SWLOR community.</p>
<p>Customized item tickets facilitate the creation of unique equipment, ensuring each character can own items that embody their journey and prowess. Event requests enable players to coordinate complex in-game events, enriching the social fabric of the SWLOR universe.</p>
<p>Moreover, portrait change requests offer players the opportunity to alter their character's visual representation, while skill mastery requests allow for the enhancement of character abilities, further diversifying each player's experience.</p>
<p>DM tickets also serve a crucial role in maintaining the harmony and fair play of the SWLOR community by providing a platform for reporting rule infringements.</p>
<h2>Ticket Process and Formatting</h2>
<p>Tickets can be submitted on the SWLOR Discord Server at <a href="https://discord.com/channels/484936923341651971/930228689000603708">#Ticket</a>.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make it easier for DMs to process your ticket, tickets should use a format discussed below depending on the nature of the request being submitted.</p>
<h3>Custom Items</h3>
<p>The process of applying for a custom DM can be done at anytime, though it is at the DM's discretion to grant such an item. Items can be applied for on the channel of the SWLOR Discord.&nbsp;<br><br>When submitting a request, please add the following information to your ticket in this format:</p>
<p><strong>Character Name:</strong><br><strong>Item Name:</strong><br><strong>Type:</strong><br><strong>Enhancements:</strong><br><strong>Description:</strong><br><br>At the end of the request, take some time to explain any additional background information about the item, and how or where your character would have come across the item.</p>
<h4>Enhancements</h4>
<p>When selecting an enhancement for an equipable item, two can be selected from the table below. The same enhancement can be taken twice to get a stronger, single enhancement - Accuracy +10, for example.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Event Requests</h3>
<p>Event requests represent a critical aspect of the ticket system in SWLOR. This category caters to players seeking a tailored in-game experience that aligns with their character's narrative trajectory, providing an enriching addition to the standard gameplay.</p>
<p>The process facilitates substantive dialogue between the player and the Dungeon Master (DM) or Quest Master (QM) team, allowing for the co-creation of customized events or quest chains. During these discussions, players can articulate the desired progression for their characters, participate in written role-play scenarios such as correspondences, and collaborate with the DM team to formulate individual events or an entire series of quests. Further, players can request that other players are added to the ticket so multiple player character can collaborate.</p>
<p>To streamline the process, a specific ticket format is recommended for players to use when submitting an event request. This structure helps ensure clarity in communication and efficiency in ticket resolution:</p>
<p><strong>Player Character Name:</strong><br><strong>Desired Event/Quest Chain:</strong>&nbsp;<br>(Briefly describe the event or quest chain you would like to request)<br><strong>Character Path:</strong>&nbsp;<br>(Outline the intended progression for your character and how this event/quest chain fits into that trajectory)<br><strong>Role-play Elements:</strong>&nbsp;<br>(Describe any minor role-play scenarios, like correspondences or Discord-style handouts, you would like to see incorporated)<br><strong>DM/QM Preferences:</strong>&nbsp;<br>(If you have a preference for a specific DM or QM to facilitate your event/quest chain, please mention it here)<br><strong>Additional Information:</strong>&nbsp;<br>(Include any other information you think is relevant to your event request)</p>
<h3>Portrait Changes</h3>
<p>The ticket system also provides players the ability to request a custom portrait change. Your portrait can be uploaded to the server's Discord (<a href="https://discord.com/channels/484936923341651971/1054572860942860469">#Custom Character Portraits Thread</a>) for everyone to download so they can see it in game. The portrait must be put in your \Documents\Neverwinter Nights\portraits folder to appear in game.</p>
<p>For more information on converting a portrait for use in Neverwinter Nights, see <a href="http://www.neverwinternights.info/portraits.htm">here</a>.<br><br>To make this quicker for DMs and QMs to accomplish, provide the following information in your ticket:<br><br><strong>Player Character Name:</strong>&nbsp;<br><strong>Desired Portrait File Name:</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Mastery Requests</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Mastery requests </strong>provide players the opportunity to submit mastery requests, enhancing the skills and abilities of their characters. Mastery requests are generally permitted after a character has be around for 14 days on the server, but this rule isn't a hard and fast one as masteries can be granted at DM discretion. Character age on the server can be determined by using <code>/char</code>.</p>
<p>Players can list multiple masteries sequentially, setting a queue for their skill enhancements. It's essential for players to understand that these masteries will be commenced in the order they are listed. This allows for a strategic approach to character development, with players having the ability to plan their character's skill progression over time.</p>
<p>To ensure an efficient and clear process, players are encouraged to use a specific template when submitting a mastery request. Here is the recommended format:</p>
<p><strong>Player Character Name:</strong><br><strong>Character Age:</strong>&nbsp;<br>(Use the /char command in-game and list your character's age)<br><strong>Mastery Request(s):</strong>&nbsp;<br>(List the masteries you wish to acquire, in the order you want them to be initiated)<br><strong>Reason for Request(s):</strong>&nbsp;<br><strong>Additional Information:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a complete list of masteries, see <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16FXf2Tg2LEYP614gFhE8ENGXaY7RRRW24ENiissJg_A/edit#gid=0">here</a>.</p>
