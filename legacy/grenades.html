<p style="text-align:center;">Grenade Throwing and Grenade Range</p>
<p>Grenade accuracy-</p>
<p>The user rolls a d100 against a variable DC calculated by these factors; Throwing Skill and Grenade Proficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>100 - 5 - Throwing Skill = DC. A D100 is rolled without any modifiers and combats the prior calculated DC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>EX: You are throwing a grenade. You have 67 levels in Throwing, and have 6 levels of the Grenade Proficiency Perk. Your DC is 100 - 5 - 67 - 1 = 27. You now roll a D100, and you must beat 27 on the dice to complete the throw. If you had no levels in the Grenade Proficiency Perk, it would be 100 - 5 - 67 = 28</p>
<p>Your range on grenades is based on your strength modifier (not score). The distance unit is based off of the 10x10 meter-tile system of NWN, and as such, no real caliber for distance as a unit exists in either feet or meters. For simplicity, it's easiest to proceed and assume the measurement is being made in meters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;10m + (2* Strength Modifier) &nbsp;= Maximum Throw Distance</p>
<p>EX: Someone with a strength score of 70 &nbsp;will have a modifier of 30, which comes out to 10 meters + 60 meters, or 70 meters. This is roughly equivalent to being able to clear 7 tiles worth of distance with a grenade toss.</p>
