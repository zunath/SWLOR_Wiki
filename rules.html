<p>For any role-play experience, it's important that everyone operates from a set of mutually agreed upon rules. Please read through the following. Ignorance is not an excuse.</p>
<p>The following rules have to do with RP conduct, character creation and general server rules. For PvP, see the following: <a href="/PvP-Rules">PvP-Rules</a></p>
<h2>Respect</h2>
<p>The most important rule is to have respect for your fellow player, and for the server as a whole. Disrespectful behavior or actions can and will result in a dismissal from the server. We are one community here, and whatever is happening in-character should not be allowed to influence out-of-character feelings.</p>
<p>Yes, we all can get a little emotionally invested in the going-ons of our characters and factions. Please do not let these events turn you toxic or bitter toward others.</p>
<p>Also, this is very important. No real life slurs or bigotry is allowed. Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and the like will NOT be permitted and are thoroughly bannable offenses.</p>
<p>RP of mental health issues should be kept tasteful, and should never involve self harm.</p>
<h2>PG-13</h2>
<p>Swearing is allowed but should be kept in tasteful moderation. If you need to ask how much is too much, you're doing it too much.</p>
<p>Explicit sexual references or narration is not allowed on this server, regardless of what channel you use. Romance/flirtatious/suggestive RP needs to be kept SFW.</p>
<p>Violence, torture, etc., should not be spelled out in too graphic a detail. Use restraint, and understand that it's usually just as effective, if not more, to leave something unsaid as opposed to describing it in detail.</p>
<h3>Pregnancy and Children in SWLOR</h3>
<p>All characters must be adults. No minors are allowed to be RP'd. Characters should be a minimum of 18 years old or whatever the age of majority is for their given species if that is longer. The sole exceptions are droids.</p>
<p>The roleplay of ones pregnancy is to be done entirely off screen. Pregnant characters bring with them too many issues and implications for the comfort of the playerbase and the staff.</p>
<h2>Character Names</h2>
<p>Character names should be kept serious and appropriate for the setting. They must also not feature any sort of canon names without DM approval. Joke names are not allowed, nor are blank names. A DM can, at any time, ask you to change your name or change it for you if we find it to be inappropriate.</p>
<h2>Unsupported Species</h2>
<p>It is permissible to have your character be a member of any species that can be reasonably portrayed with existing assets, even if they are not on the race list. If you're not sure if something is allowed, please make a ticket on our discord and ask.</p>
<p>A species should generally not provide any significant RP powers. A Zeltron with limited empathic skills, or a Miraluka with Force Sight, is fine. But a Massassi is not, nor any member of the Sith species. It's usually a good idea to open a ticket prior to making a member of any non-supported species that has powers beyond the norm.</p>
<h2>Unsupported Powers/Devices/Abilities</h2>
<p>Players should feel free to flavor or utilize powers in new and creative ways, to establish their PC's own unique identity there. So long as dark side powers remain dark side powers, and light side powers remain light side powers, the DM team is fine with what you portray a Force Disturbance as being, for instance.</p>
<p>However, it's important to note that ultimately the effectiveness of powers in most RP scenarios is going to be up to the one being acted upon, unless a DM rules otherwise. If you try to mind trick a player into doing something, it's up to them how that affects them. This is especially true of non-supported powers. If, for instance, you use <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Light">Force Light</a> on a Sith, they're within their rights to say how that affects them. If it rebounds on you, it's up to you how it affects you.</p>
<h2>Rank/Power Progression</h2>
<p>It is wholly up to an individual player to police how quickly they progress from being a complete beginner in a particular form, power, etc. (Example: Shii Cho.) However, they should generally not be portraying themselves through emotes as a legitimate master of something unless they have a mastery rank in it. Acting as though you're proficient, skilled even, is fine. Just avoid over the top emotes of how your two day old Sith is basically Palpatine as you electrocute jungle bugs.</p>
<p>Any promotion being conducted past the starter ranks of a faction should be preceded by a ticket notifying the DM team so we aren't being blindsided by people suddenly being at a very high rank. These are not hard to get approved.</p>
<p>Please submit a ticket to the DM's as well if you want to pursue being a <a href="/Gameplay/RP_Training_Guide/Masteries">Master</a> of a particular ability. These are primarily there for RP flavor, events, and occasionally offer some mechanical advantages (though should not be taken for mechanical advantages). For non-supported powers like Force Light, Necromancy, Alchemy, etc., having a mastery is often, but not always, a good idea before using them. A general rule of thumb is that any Rare mastery should not be used without one mastery rank. If in doubt, ask a DM.</p>
<h2>Faction Betrayal</h2>
<p><mark class="pen-red">IMPORTANT NOTE:</mark> Due to a recent flurry of instances of betrayals/spying/sabotage incidents, it's strongly encouraged that players not try to engage in this behavior. If you feel you need to, still make a ticket of course, and we'll talk it over with you. It's been happening so much lately though that we'd prefer it not happen without very good IC (and perhaps OOC) reasons.</p>
<p>Betrayal of one's factions should be seen as a serious affair. The DM team will tend to be more willing to override the PvP consent rules for permadeath, capture and disfigurement when it comes to betrayal. This is especially true for betrayals where you were higher ranking, or particularly knowledgeable in the going ons of the faction, or where you begin to PvP members of your previous faction willingly.</p>
<p>Eventually, this status will fade away. But any faction betrayal should be seen as inviting consequences up to and including permadeath to your PC. It doesn't mean it will happen, just that it can.</p>
<p>Please submit a ticket to the DM team prior to any betrayal.</p>
<h2>Faction Spying/Sabotage</h2>
<p>Like with betrayal, Spying and Sabotage of a faction carries with it the same possible consequences. Further, the DM team will establish rules for your spying, usually involving who you are and are not allowed to hand off information to. Often, the DM team will just have you hand off information to NPC's, rather than PC's, or only to a few high ranking PC's. Deviation from these rules being put in place surrounding your spy status must be accompanied by DM approval. (Example: Warning PC's of something when NPC's are the ones you're supposed to be feeding information to.)</p>
<p>You should keep such things a secret OOC as well as IC as much as is possible. Ideally, metagaming your status as an infiltrator should be impossible.</p>
<h2>Capture</h2>
<p>Capture is a serious thing. If you're a Sith, and you get captured by the Jedi, for instance, you're basically in Permadeath territory. It's preferred that after PvP, the defeated party miraculously escape or survive a seemingly fatal wound rather than to be hauled off across the galaxy and put in a cell. If you do find yourself captured, one way or another, understand that your PC may not be playable for a period of time (or at least may not have much to do or people to talk to if you do log onto them). You risk being severed from the force, forcibly corrupted to the Dark Side, permanently imprisoned, or in extreme situations outright killed.</p>
<p>It's possible to come back from everything short of permadeath, to regain your force sensitivity, be redeemed, or escape from whatever maximum security facility you're sent to, but it'll be a difficult and often time consuming thing. Other players can work to raid wherever you're being held, or you can take a risk and try to escape yourself. Obviously, others helping you is going to have a lower risk of permadeath than you escaping on your lonesome. Having allies helps.</p>
<p>Most captures will not end in death or perma. But you should not enter into that territory casually, and should not be surprised if your character emerges from the experience changed.</p>
<h2>OOC Chat</h2>
<p>Usage of // chat should be kept to a tasteful minimum. Use tells whenever possible. Please strive to maintain the immersion of your fellow players.</p>
<p>Similarly, we'd ask that OOC channels not be used to discuss IC matters. This ranges from Discord Faction OOC chats, to tells. If it can be discussed in-character, it should be.</p>
<h2>QM Rules</h2>
<p>Quest Masters are valued members of the staff who are intended to help run events for the DM team. They are not there to handle the administrative side of matters without DM approval. Quest Masters are free to run events independently, have NPC interactions with players, and fulfill event request tokens. They should avoid running events that alter the political or military landscape of the server by significant degrees, at least not without DM approval, and should steer well clear of the main story stuff (KOTOR 1 and KOTOR 2) without Head DM approval.</p>
<ul>
  <li>QM's cannot permakill characters or impose disfigurement or otherwise without approval of the DM team.</li>
  <li>QM's need to reach out to DM's prior to responding to any non-event request ticket.</li>
  <li>QM's should notify DM's of their events prior to running them. If they're liable to involve significant changes to the political or military landscape they must await approval.</li>
  <li>QM's are welcome to introduce new faction assets, such as capital ships, but should be mindful of the overall power balance between factions and not keep such minimal and mostly focused on their events unless told otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish to become a QM, please submit a ticket and we'll discuss it with you and amongst ourselves.</p>
<h2>Specific Powers</h2>
<h3>Force Sight</h3>
<p>Force Sight is a manner of “seeing” that does not rely upon light. Instead, it grants a user a clear image of the aura of everything around them. As it's not based on light, but instead involves seeing through the Force, it functions quite a bit differently in how it works.</p>
<p>Force Sight CAN:</p>
<ul>
  <li>See “auras” that players willingly place in their description.</li>
  <li>See through limited barriers (ice, water, clouds, thin barriers, low density materials, etc., but can't see through force imbued objects)</li>
  <li>Ignore blinding effects such as bright lights.</li>
  <li>Identify players by their “characteristic aura," instead of by their general appearance. (Pay close attention to disguises, below.)</li>
  <li>See through illusions that rely purely on sight, but do not also create a false force presence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Force Sight CAN NOT:</p>
<ul>
  <li>See color, light or holograms. Some technology exists for the Miraluka allowing this, but it tends to be something built into a starship or building than for a portable holocomm. Holocrons are all force imbued and so are visible through Force Sight.</li>
  <li>See through disguises without consent. (This means a disguised PC is, somehow, consciously or otherwise, disguising their aura as well.)</li>
  <li>Read screens not specifically designed for Force Sight. (Again, Miraluka tech.)</li>
  <li>See fine detail other than changes in texture, phases of matter. Shading is invisible to Force Sight.</li>
  <li>Distinguish between near humans unless there are obvious physical differences. This means a Zabrak or Miraluka is easily distinguished, but you couldn't tell whether someone were Zeltron, Human, Mirialan or Echani through Force Sight. You couldn't even see the Mirialan's tattoos.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Force Bond</h3>
<p>Force Bonds are a significant thing for two people to have, usually coming about as a result of profoundly impactful shared experiences between two force sensitives. They emerge most often in times of great struggle.</p>
<p>Players wishing to have a Force Bond are asked to make a ticket first requesting it. You can also take a Mastery level in it to strengthen the bond beyond its non-mastered level.</p>
<p>A basic Force Bond allows for a very basic empathic link between two people. You can use tells back and forth to let the other person know if you're near or far, and what you're feeling. With multiple ranks in Mentalism or just one Force Bond mastery between you, more complex thoughts can begin to be shared, including words. With Force Bond ranks, you can also gain additional advantages during events.</p>
<p>It is important to note that regardless of how many ranks you have, you cannot use tells during or for PvP without approval of a DM or the opposing team. For example, if you're captured, request permission from your captor before sending tells to notify someone.</p>
<p>Please do not trivialize force bonds by requesting them for someone you've just met. A significant backstory relationship between you and another person, or a prolonged period of time spent together going on adventures, is fine.</p>
