<h1>Space Ships, Space, and You!</h1>
<p><i>It isn’t Star Wars without space travel. This guide provides both the need to know and then the nitty gritty of space travel.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To begin piloting, you’ll need to spend one perk point to buy rank one in Starships under the Piloting skill. You’ll only ever need one rank in Starships to fly Tier 1 ships (such as the <i>Light Freighter</i>, the <i>Light Escort</i>, the <i>Striker</i>, and the <i>Condor</i>.) If you want to fly any of the more advanced ships, you’ll need to invest more into the Starships perk. More information on ships can be found in the Starships Guide.</p>
<p>Next, you’ll need to get your hands on a Ship Deed. You can buy the Light Freighter or the Light Escort from the Dockhand at any Starport, or you can find a Striker or Condor for sale on the GTN (the player marketplace). Once you have the deed, talk to the Dockhand and select ”<i>Manage Ships</i>”. You’ll be greeted by a new NUI window.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Press I to open your character’s inventory, then click <i>Register Ship</i>. Then, click on the ship deed within your inventory. Now your ship is registered!</p>
<p>[photo here]</p>
<p>From here, you can give your ship a unique name, install modules, and edit permissions to your ship.</p>
<p>To install High Powered modules you’ll need to invest in the <i>Offensive Modules </i>Piloting Perk. For Low Powered modules, you’ll need the <i>Defensive Modules </i>Piloting Perk. Rank 1 in either of these perks will give you access to the basic level of module, which you can also buy from the Dockhand’s shop.</p>
<p>Note, in order to fly ships with more advanced modules, you’ll need the corresponding rank in either module perk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you’re done getting your ship ready, you can board the ship pressing the Board Ship button. Now all you have to do is find the ship’s bridge and click on the ship’s computer. DON’T MOVE after you’ve clicked the computer, just wait for your character to finish fully loading into space. Your character model will be replaced with a little space ship model, and now you’re free to fly around. Look for Starlanes to jump to the orbits of other planets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, the space zones avaliable are the orbits for: Viscara, Korriban, Mon Cala, Hutlar, and Tattooine. The threat level for these zones is equivilant to the level of the planet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ship Storage</h3>
<p>All ships provide you with a base 25 slots for item storage. You can access your ship storage from the Property Menu (Special Abilities → Standard/Force Sensitive → Property Menu).&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Photo]</p>
<p>Click Open Storage to open your ship’s storage.</p>
<p>[Photo]</p>
<p>You can edit the name of the categories at the top right bar when you have the category selected. At the bottom left, you can delete or add new categories. When you have a category selected, the Permissions button will un-grey, meaning you can use the search bar to type in a character‘s name to give them access to that category. Storage access for non-owners of the ship is by category, so your friends will only have access to the categories you give them access too.</p>
<p>[Photo]</p>
<p>If you want to add more storage slots to your ship, just fill it with furniture! One piece of furniture = one slot of inventory space. You can quickly access all the furniture you’ve placed down in your property from here, edit ship permissions, and access your ship storage.</p>
<h2>Space Combat</h2>
<p>In space, your character’s stat bar has been replaced with three new colors:</p>
<p>[Photo]</p>
<p>You got a preview of these from the Dockhand’s menu when you had your ship selected, so now it’s time to dive into what these mean.</p>
<p>The blue bar stands for Shield integrity. Damage sustained will drain the shields first before damaging the Hull. Your shields will naturally regenerate over time by a small amount.</p>
<p>The red bar stands for Hull integrity. Once the shields have been drained, damage will begin draining the Hull integrity. Once you hit 0, your ship is beyond repair, and you die. There is no way to be ressusitated in space, so if you die, you’ll have to respawn and go to the medbay. Hull integrity does not regenerate naturally like Shields do either, so you’ll need to get them repaired either from another player or by paying out to the Dockhand at the starport.</p>
<p>The yellow bar stands for Capacitors. Like stamina or force points, the Capacitor represents how many points you have to spend using your high powered modules. Modules that are higher rank cost more capacity to use per click, so bare that in mind when outfitting your ship. You can hit 0 on the Capacitor with no maleffects, you just won’t be able to use any of your modules until you’ve regenerated some. The Capacitor can regenerate on it’s own at a reasonable rate when left idle.</p>
<p>You can adjust how much Shields, Hull, and Capacitor you have by adding the corresponding Low Powered modules onto your ship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like the rest of SWOLR, space combat is based off the 1d100 system. Your ability points in willpower and agility, your skill investment in piloting, and the modules installed on your ship all contributed to how effective you are at hitting your targets, how much damage you do, and how easy it is for you to be hit.</p>
<p>To hit an enemy ship, all you have to do is click on it to select it. You’ll see the enemy’s stat bar appear above your own.</p>
<p>[Photo]</p>
<p>Now all you have to do is click on the module you want to use to attack them with.</p>
<p>[Photo]</p>
<p>That’s all there is to it! If you have support modules on your ship, like Hull Repair beams or Shield Repair lasers (high powered modules) you‘ll have to target the ship you want to use it on. To target a friendly ship, chose the attack button from the radial menu. Don’t worry, this won’t attack the player, it’ll just select them. Like when selecting enemy ships, you’ll see their stat bar above your own. From here, just click on the module you want to use.</p>

<h2>Space Mining</h2>
<p>Space mining is easy. All you have to do is click on the asteroid you want to harvest, then click on your mining laser. Higher ranks of asteroids need higher ranks of mining lasers, and so the corresponding Space Mining Perk is also needed.</p>
<p>Tiliarium: Tier 1, Basic Mining Laser</p>
<p>Currian: Tier 2, Level 1 Mining Laser</p>
<p>Idalila: Tier 3, Level 2 Mining Laser</p>
<p>Barinium: Tier 4, Level 3 Mining Laser&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gostian: Tier 5, Level 4 Mining Laser</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
