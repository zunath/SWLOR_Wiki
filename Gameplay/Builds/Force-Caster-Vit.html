<h1>Force Caster</h1>
<p>A fairly standard grade caster build. It's melee damage is farily pathetic, but it has reasonable survivability if geared for it, and of course max casting stats.</p>
<h2>Capabilities</h2>
<p>Maximized DC on force powers. Massive FP pool. Decent base Stamina pool. Reasonable survivability based on gear. Maximized regen on FP and STM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Starting Stats, Ability Points, Skills</h1>
<p>Characters start with a base attribute score of 10 in every Attribute.</p>
<p>You have 15 points to spend on these Attributes at character creation. Your Cap for each attribute is defined by your starting Attribute + 10. The table below is an example attribute spread for the outlined build. Please note that no guarantee is given that the build is still viable if you drastically change the distribution of these points. Refer to the “Basic Character Creation” (TODO) guide on which attributes may be more critical than others.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Like most of my builds, I will not focus much on what skills to take aside from the necessary ones for combat.</p>
<h2>Key Perks</h2>
<p>Here, I highly recommend going light armor, for obvious reasons. Your focus hear will be force powers. Specific perks will of course depend on whther going for light or dark side. I highly recommend taking Force Body on this build to have a near infinite pool of FP. I also would lean to using a single saber, personally. The doublehand bonus is really about the only way I've found to do any melee damage at all with such low perception. That said, even then it is far behind anything resembling actual damage.</p>
<h1>Gear, Equipment and Consumables</h1>
<h2>Gearing</h2>
<p>Explain what weapons to use, and why. Which Armor to wear in what slot, and why. Outline the basic modifications that should be used for end-game gear.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: *RR = Recast Reduction</p>
<p>I consider the Recast reduction abilities on the main armor pieces near required for a build focused entirely on casting. The ones with Evasion however, you have options. If you do not mind being a pure glass cannon and really want huge numbers consider swapping to Force Attack over Evasion. I'd not recommend this for newer players, however, which is what these builds are geared towards by default.</p>
<h2>Weapon</h2>
<p>The exact weapon choice is really up to you. I'll say now that the melee damage output of this build is pathetic. Even using doublehand on a single saber with rage and power attack it's not worth much in DPS melee wise. The strength of this build is entirely in it's damage through Force abilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Variations</h1>
<p>Curiously, this build also can make for quite a durable tank. Swapping entirely to heavy armor, and tossing away all recast reduction for more evasion or HP will give you decent evasion and HP and resistances. Combine that with a still very large force pool, and abilities like Force Heal/Drain that care little for your slow casting speed, and the massive bonus to healing on med kits and it is amazingly hard to bring down. I personally play a version of this build like that. That said, the tank version of this build can be quite dull, since it has very low damage potential, especially in most PvE environments.</p>
