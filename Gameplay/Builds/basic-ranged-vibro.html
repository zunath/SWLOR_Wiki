<h1>Build Outline</h1>
<p>This is intended to provide a basic template for any sort of character utilizing Blaster Pistols, Rifles or Finesse Vibroblades. The basic gameplay loop will consist of buffing yourself and allies through the very strong abilities in the Devices and First Aid trees, and then utilizing your weapon or utility abilities during combat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Capabilities</h2>
<p>This is a very good all-round build that will perform well in any sort of PvE or PvP encounter. It focuses a bit more on potential evasion, accuracy and damage than straight out physical defense or max HP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to being an AGI/PER build it will struggle when having to carry large amounts of resources for crafting, and will not be the best pick for using Smithery for your crafting skill though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Starting Stats, Ability Points, Skills</h1>
<p>Characters start with a base attribute score of 10 in every Attribute.</p>
<p>You have 15 points to spend on these Attributes at character creation. Your Cap for each attribute is defined by your starting Attribute + 10. The table below is an example attribute spread for the outlined build. Please note that no guarantee is given that the build is still viable if you drastically change the distribution of these points.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will additionally gain 35 AP (Attribute Points) to spend as you gain Skills during gameplay. Every 10 ranks of skill you can will provide one AP.</p>

<p>Possible choices for the unallocated points include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Engineering<br>Fabrication<br>Agriculture<br>Piloting<br>A secondary weapon tree (One-Handed if Blaster, Ranged if Finesse Vibroblade)</p>
<p>Smithery is not recommended due to low MGT which may lead to difficulties applying late-game enhancements.</p>
<h2>Key Perks</h2>
<p>Pick the relevant Proficiency, Mastery and Weapon Ability Perks for your relevant chosen weapon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pick the Proficiences for Light Armor, unless you want to mix and match gear. (See section: "Gear, Equipment and Consumables", below)</p>
<h3>Devices</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Adhesive Grenade III (Want to Kite? This is how you kite.)</li>
  <li>Kolto Grenade III (Heal over Time)</li>
  <li>Smoke Bomb III (invisibility Field for disengaging, especially useful in PvP)</li>
  <li>Stealth Generator III (Can be comboed with Smoke Bomb for disengaging)</li>
  <li>Flamethrower III (useful AoE damage when faced with multiple, weaker opponents especially in DM Events)</li>
  <li>Wrist Rocket III (A ranged knockdown. Especially useful in PvP)<ul>
      <li>Optional: Deflector Shield III (15% Temp HP for your group is nice, but not essential for soloing given the lower max HP of this build reduces efficiency)</li>
      <li>Concussive (Knockdown), Frag (Burning) or Flashbang (reduced Accuracy) Grenades. Listed in subjective descending order of usefulness.</li>
      <li>Kolto Bomb III (Heal for everyone standing in the field. Especially useful for DM Events)</li>
