<h1>Build Outline</h1>
<p>This is intended to provide a basic template for any sort of character utilizing Blaster Pistols, Rifles or Finesse Vibroblades. The basic gameplay loop will consist of buffing yourself and allies through the very strong abilities in the Devices and First Aid trees, and then utilizing your weapon or utility abilities during combat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Capabilities</h2>
<p>This is a very good all-round build that will perform well in any sort of PvE or PvP encounter. It focuses a bit more on potential evasion, accuracy and damage than straight out physical defense or max HP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to being an AGI/PER build it will struggle when having to carry large amounts of resources for crafting, and will not be the best pick for using Smithery for your crafting skill though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Starting Stats, Ability Points, Skills</h1>
<p>Characters start with a base attribute score of 10 in every Attribute.</p>
<p>You have 15 points to spend on these Attributes at character creation. Your Cap for each attribute is defined by your starting Attribute + 10. The table below is an example attribute spread for the outlined build. Please note that no guarantee is given that the build is still viable if you drastically change the distribution of these points.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will additionally gain 35 AP (Attribute Points) to spend as you gain Skills during gameplay. Every 10 ranks of skill you can will provide one AP.</p>

<p>Possible choices for the unallocated points include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Engineering<br>Fabrication<br>Agriculture<br>Piloting<br>A secondary weapon tree (One-Handed if Blaster, Ranged if Finesse Vibroblade)</p>
<p>Smithery is not recommended due to low MGT which may lead to difficulties applying late-game enhancements.</p>
<h2>Key Perks</h2>
<p>Pick the relevant Proficiency, Mastery and Weapon Ability Perks for your relevant chosen weapon. Make sure to also check the “general” section of your specific weapon group.</p>
<p>In the Armor tree, pick up all the general proficiences (perhaps apart from Provoke) and the ones in Light Armor unless you want to mix and match armor pieces. (See gearing section for why and how).</p>
<h3>Special Mentions</h3>
<p>Ranged General, Rapid Shot: Gives Blaster Pistols +1 Attack per Round</p>
<p>Ranged General, Rapid Reload: Needed for Blaster Rifles to gain Attacks per Round</p>
<p>Martial Arts, Knockdown: Does what it says on the tin. Yes, it does work with ranged weapons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Doublehand vs Dual Wield</h3>
<p>Any weapon in the One-Handed Tree (aswell as Lightsabers) can either be Dual-Wielded, or use a special feat called “Doublehand" which increases the primary weapon damage when your off-hand is empty. The general consensus is that Doublehanding will deal more damage against enemies with a high dodge chance (due to the Accuracy penalty when dual wielding) and Dual Wielding will do more damage against enemies with a lower dodge chance (due to the potentially higher max damage provided by the two additional attacks).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Devices</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Adhesive Grenade III (Want to Kite? This is how you kite.)</li>
  <li>Kolto Grenade III (Heal over Time)</li>
  <li>Smoke Bomb III (invisibility Field for disengaging, especially useful in PvP)</li>
  <li>Stealth Generator III (Can be comboed with Smoke Bomb for disengaging)</li>
  <li>Flamethrower III (useful AoE damage when faced with multiple, weaker opponents especially in DM Events)</li>
  <li>Wrist Rocket III (A ranged knockdown. Especially useful in PvP)<ul>
      <li>Optional: Deflector Shield III (15% Temp HP for your group is nice, but not essential for soloing given the lower max HP of this build reduces efficiency)</li>
      <li>Concussive (Knockdown), Frag (Burning) or Flashbang (reduced Accuracy) Grenades. Listed in subjective descending order of usefulness.</li>
      <li>Kolto Bomb III (Heal for everyone standing in the field. Especially useful for DM Events)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>First Aid</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Med Kit V (Single target heal)</li>
  <li>Resusciation III (In and Out Of Combat resurrection)</li>
  <li>Treatment Kit II (Condition Cleanse)</li>
  <li>Combat enhancement III ("Free" 3 Attribute points in MGT, PER and VIT for group members. Especially useful for buffing 2h Frontliners. Absolute must take, spread it arround your entire party, this ability is your single biggest buff!)</li>
  <li>Shielding IV (Defense buff. Extremely useful for buffing Heavy Armor Physical Defense builds!)</li>
  <li>Stasis Field III (This build assumes you will go for a dodge build. Absolute must have if that is the case.)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Gathering</h3>
<p>Harvesting and especially Scavenging Perks will likely be a main source of income for your character, and as such aren't really considered optional in the author's opinion. Pick them all. Consider Creditfinder III if you are going to spend a significant amount of time picking up the supply chests in the Tusken Camp, otherwise, disregard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Crafting</h3>
<p>Way too complex to cover for this guide. Ask questions in Discord, or hope someone makes a comprehensive crafting guide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Gear, Equipment and Consumables</h1>
<h2>Armor</h2>
<p>Two paths to take depending on playstyle.</p>
<p>Path A: Go full Light Armor and put Evasion Mods into every slot (apart from jewelry). This will result in you having high natural Stamina regeneration to keep using your abilities like Kolto Grenades, Weapon Perks and assisting any dedicated medics or healers of your party in keeping people up and going. Note that using Heavy Armor Jewelry does not require the Heavy Armor perks!</p>
<p>Path B: Mix and match in more pieces of Heavy Armor (start with: Gloves → Boots/Helmet → Chest last.) if you want a higher pyhsical defense score, at the cost of regeneration. I'm unsure whether an Evasion focused build is still the way to go here, or whether you would want to stack Physical Defense in your modification slots instead.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Weapon</h2>
<p>Take the respective T5 (Ophidian) Weapon as Base. When applying mods to it, decide if you want to go for higher average damage, or higher damage on low defense enemies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Average Damage = 2x Physical Enhancement</p>
<p>High Damage against Low Defense = 2x Elemental Enhancement (don't mix and match, stick to one!)</p>
<p>On Finesse Vibroblade, it may be more worth adding to the inherent elemental (mostly Poison) damage on the weapon. This is untested, if anyone can provide feedback, that would be great.</p>
<h1>Variations</h1>
<p>You can take VIT to 16 instead of PER at character start. In this case you are a more tanky, slightly less damage version of this build. In that case I would definitely recommend going for the Heavy Armor and Physical Defense Modification route in the Gearing/Armor section.</p>
<p>The 5 AP spent into WIL can instead be spent on MGT for a higher carry capacity which can help a lot when acquiring metals and ores, and is just generally convenient.</p>
