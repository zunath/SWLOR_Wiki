<h1>Force Melee - Tank variant</h1>
<p>A fairly standard grade melee force Sensitive build. Focused on survivability and raw melee power. Limited Force abilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Capabilities</h2>
<p>Generally very survivable when geared up. Flexible with minor changes in stat distribution and gearing. Minimal force power and pool, however (50). But enough to cover some buffs and healing. Decent Stamina pool (60) without needing to use light armor. Generally good regeneration on both and high elemental resistance due to near max Vitality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Starting Stats, Ability Points, Skills</h1>
<p>Characters start with a base attribute score of 10 in every Attribute.</p>
<p>You have 15 points to spend on these Attributes at character creation. Your Cap for each attribute is defined by your starting Attribute + 10. The table below is an example attribute spread for the outlined build. Please note that no guarantee is given that the build is still viable if you drastically change the distribution of these points. Refer to the “Basic Character Creation” (TODO) guide on which attributes may be more critical than others.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Here is where variation is most accessible. If you really want bigger damage numbers there are two options. Swapping Per to 26, and reducing Agi to 23. Putting you at 26/26 with buffs. However this costs Accuracy, Evasion and Stamina. You could swap Vitality of course, as well. But this is a tank variant.</p>
<p><i>The +1 in Might could seem an odd choice. Really its just for some carry cap, and more importantly an extra +1 saving throw. The difference is minimal, but then so is going from 22 to 23 in Perception for a force sensitive build, damage wise.</i></p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can really go either single saber or dual. Or spec into both. I'm not bothering to fill in the last three skills. It's really whatever you want and fits RP. I'm just focused on raw fighting potential with this build. Some suggestions would be Leadership, Gathering, Beastmastery for simple easy to level skills to get you maxed out. Piloting of course is also fun if you want to go that route. Then there's Crafting skills. Really just have fun with it.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Key Perks</h2>
<p>Obvious weapon and armor perks are a must. I personally suggest going heavy armor, but light armor is very viable as well. As for Force powers, considering the nature of the build: Force Rage (or Valor), Force Speed, and Force Inspiration are obvious must haves. I'd recommend nabbing up force heal as well for generally durability. The Med-Kit perk in First Aid is also essentially a necessity.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Again there are some arguments to be had here, both in going full heavy, and in the mod choices. This setup, I think, however is the most new player friendly and forgiving. With the listed Armor and mods, with standard force buffs you hit 210 Evasion, 230 Physical Resist and 1010 HP. Fairly tanky stats overall. Alternatively you could swap into Light Armor perks, but this build has enough sustain for the most part that it is not very needed considering its minor focus on any offensive force powers.</p>
<h2>Weapon</h2>
<p>This is primarily designed towards one handed saber builds, either double hand, or dual wield. Go with those, leveling them up as tier allows. I personally prefer Accuracy mods. With your high Agility it makes hitting almost garanteed, even against very dodgy mobs. If dual wielding consider an accuracy weapon in off hand and damage modded weapon in main hand for a good balance of to-hit and DPS.</p>
