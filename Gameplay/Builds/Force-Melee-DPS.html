<h1>Force Melee - DPS variant</h1>
<p>A fairly standard grade melee force Sensitive build. Focused on DPS and raw melee power. Limited Force abilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Capabilities</h2>
<p>Good damage when geared up, reasonably survivable for a DPS focused build. Flexible with minor changes in stat distribution and gearing. Minimal force power and pool, however (50). But enough to cover some buffs and healing. Decent Stamina pool (60) without needing to use light armor. Generally good regeneration on both and high elemental resistance due to near max Vitality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Starting Stats, Ability Points, Skills</h1>
<p>Characters start with a base attribute score of 10 in every Attribute.</p>
<p>You have 15 points to spend on these Attributes at character creation. Your Cap for each attribute is defined by your starting Attribute + 10. The table below is an example attribute spread for the outlined build. Please note that no guarantee is given that the build is still viable if you drastically change the distribution of these points. Refer to the “Basic Character Creation” (TODO) guide on which attributes may be more critical than others.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can really go either single saber or dual. Or spec into both. Generally I think using an off hand accuracy weapon and a main hand damage weapon is technically best. But it's not a big deal either way, really. I'm not bothering to fill in the last three skills. It's really whatever you want and fits RP. I'm just focused on raw fighting potential with this build. Some suggestions would be Gathering, Beastmastery for simple easy to level skills to get you maxed out. Piloting of course is also fun if you want to go that route. Then there's Crafting skills. Really just have fun with it.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Key Perks</h2>
<p>Obvious weapon and armor perks are a must. I personally suggest going heavy armor, but light armor is very viable as well. As for Force powers, considering the nature of the build: Force Rage (or Valor), Force Speed, and Force Inspiration are obvious must haves. I'd recommend nabbing up force heal as well for generally durability. The Med-Kit perk in First Aid is also essentially a necessity. You're taking Leadership simply for Frenzied Shout. With low Social the impact is minimal, but this is a DPS build, so taking every advantage I can for more damage.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Again there are some arguments to be had here for light armor. However, I think tha added defense is worth the trade since you'll be hit a bit more and have less natural Damage Resistance than higher Vitality builds. Reaches 194 Attack with Force buffs (including Rage), and 190 Evasion.</p>
<h2>Weapon</h2>
<p>This is primarily designed towards one handed saber builds, either double hand, or dual wield. For maximum DPS I think dual wielding edges out Doublehand, but either are playable. I recommend an off hand accuracy mod, and raw damage on main hand if dual weilding.</p>
