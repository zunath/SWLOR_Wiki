# Character Creation
SWLOR - A highly customized module for the Star Wars universe!

SWLOR has a comprehensive mechanics design document available for reference. In the Discord enter ?bible to get a link to this same resource at any time!

You select "perks" rather than feats, and you do this from the character menu in game. Which does include equipping armor/weapons so you'll need to do this as soon as you've created your character. Initially your perk points are small so focus on getting your armor perks and primary weapon to start with. Skills are earned with the activities in game, and roleplay XP is automatically distributed based on how much roleplay you're doing around other characters.

## Force Sensitive vs Standard
One of your major initial decisions you make during creation is whether your character is Force Sensitive or not.

This choice will determine what Perks your character can buy. For example, all Force powers are only available to Force Sensitive characters. The ability to use stims, as well as the top end of other skill trees, are only available to Standard characters. Check the Design Bible for these limitations. 

## Races
There are a host of races available to play, and since there are no assigned racial attribute points you can play any that you'd like.
The droid is the only character that is Standard Character limited, all others have the option of Force Sensitivity or Standard Character play.

## Weapons
This section is slotted higher because it's the second most important initial decision for character creation. What weapon you choose will affect the attributes you then select and the perks that you are going to be able to access.

Weapons are either Melee or Ranged

Ranged
Pistols and Rifles use Agility to hit, and Perception to do damage. 
Shurkien is Agility to hit, and Might to damage.
(Zen archery allows standard characters to use Willpower in place of Perception for damage.)

Melee weapons - Accuracy stat/Damage stat
Vibroblade - PER/MIGHT
Finesse Vibroblade - AGI/PER
Great Sword - PER/MIGHT
Polearm (spear) - PER/MIGHT
Katar - AGI/PER
Staff - PER/MIGHT
Twin Blade - AGI/MIGHT

Lightsaber/Saberstaff/Electroblade/Twin Electroblade - AGI/PER
Strong style Lightsaber/Saberstaff/Electroblade/Twin Electroblade - PER/MIGHT

Additionally:
- One-hander and shield is possible.
- Due to technical issues, pistols can only be single, never dual wielded. (But you can roleplay it how you like to.)

## Attributes
SWLOR has 6 attributes.
* Might, a measure of how physically strong a character is.  This is used for carrying weight, as well as inflicting damage to certain weapons.  
* Perception, a measure of the character's situational awareness.  This can be used for accuracy or damage, depending on your build.  
* Willpower, a measure of the character's strength of will.  This is the primary attribute for using Force powers, but some standard skills (like First Aid) also use it.  It's also the primary attribute for Force Points, making it valuable to Force Sensitive characters.
* Vitality, a measure of the character's physical toughness.  This determines how many hit points you have, as well as reducing damage taken in combat.  It also determines how quickly you regenerate hit points, stamina and force points.
* Agility, a measure of the character's quickness and nimbleness.  This can be used for accuracy (particularly for ranged combat).  It also governs evasion, how well you avoid being hit.  It's also the primary attirbute for Stamina, making it valuable to Standard characters.  
* Social, a measure of the character's social grace.  This affects how much xp you earn and powers the Leadership skill tree.  Every 5 points over 10 allow you to use an additional Leadership aura power. 

All attributes start at 10.

You have the usual 30 points to spend on increasing your attributes.  Each point of raised attribute costs 2 points.  
(Most people choose a 16/16/13/10/10/10 distribution for their build, depending on what they want to do.)

*When you have a attribute point available you'll see the little plus sign next to the possible attributes you can level up!*

For every 10 combined skill points you earn you'll earn an attribute point to spend. With a cap of 350 skill points you'll be able to earn up to 35 attribute upgrades, however you can never add more than 10 to a single attribute so plan in advance how you might want to spend them.

### Abilities and Hit points, Stamina points, and Force points
Characters have 40 HP plus 40 HP for each positive point of VIT modifier, plus equipment bonuses and temporary bonuses from abilities.  So VIT makes a significant difference to your overall HP pool.  VIT also improves the regen rate of HP when resting - 1 + VIT mod HP recovered per round.

Vitality also increases your max STM (stamina) and FP (force points). However, regeneration of STM during resting is influenced by PER, and regeneration of FP during resting is influences by WIL. In both cases, 1 + half your modifier per round. 

## Perks
[Perks](https://wiki.starwarsnwn.com/en/Gameplay/character-creation/Perks) define your character's abilities.  There are two types of perk.
* Passive perks include things like weapon proficiencies, that allow you to equip different gear and use it more effectively.
* Active perks grant abilities that can be used in or out of combat.

One of the very first things you'll want to do when you roll up a new character is assign some or all of your 10 initial Perk points.  Hit C to access the character sheet and hit the Perks button to pull up the Perks window.

You can sort Perks by category.  It's a good idea to give yourself proficiency in at least one type of weapon and basic armor. Initially you will want to take care in what perks you choose.

Every time you gain a rank in a skill, you gain an additional perk point. There are ways to reset perks in game later if you take something you later regret. Use ?refund in the Discord for additional information. 

Concentration abilities:
Some active abilities allow for a target to be picked for concentration. Some, like comprehend languages, are self cast only. But effectively these abilities will not be disrupted unless you lose sight of your concentration target (range), character defeat (death), or the resource being expended (force point drain).
They have to be actively toggled OFF in order to stop draining your resource pool.

## Armor
There are no attribute requirements for which type of armor you choose. You can mix the armor types, there is only light and heavy.
Light armor generally comes with the ability to regain Force points and Stamina points more easily.
Heavy armor generally is able to grant more Health points and provide damage soak protection.
Force users that use ANY heavy armor will notice their force powers will cast more slowly, but otherwise there is no other impact.

## Final Starter Tip
Make sure that you lock the skills you want to keep. Skill decay happens when you have reached the 350 skill cap and have unlocked skills, so go ahead and lock in the ones you want to keep. All skills start as unlocked by default.
