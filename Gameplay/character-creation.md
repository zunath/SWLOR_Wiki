# Character Creation
With many custom mechanics, character creation on SWLOR is quite different from normal NWN.

In summary:
* There are a wide range of different races to choose from
* You have many fewer attribute points to spend (and only 5 attributes rather than the usual 6)
* You don't select skills at creation.  All skills are acquired by doing activities during gameplay.
* You select "perks" rather than feats, and you do this from the character menu in game.  You'll need to do this as soon as you've created your character to be able to do anything!

## Force Sensitive vs Standard
The most important decision you make during creation is whether your character is Force Sensitive or not. 	

This decision will determine what Perks your character can buy.  For example, all Force powers are only available to Force Sensitive characters.  The ability to use stims is only available to Standard characters.  

Of course, many perks are available to both - so both Force Sensitive and Standard characters can use med kits and vibroblades, for example. 

## Races
SWLOR supports a wide range of species from the Star Wars universe. 

All species get visual updates.  Additionally, they get attribute bonuses and penalties based on the following list.  Note that these initial bonuses and penalties do NOT affect the maximum attribute value your character can later attain - so while you might find your path easier or harder to start with, you don't affect your character's ultimate potential by your choice of race.

Human: +1 Vitality, -1 Perception
Bothan: +1 Perception, -1 Might
Chiss: +1 Will, -1 Vitality
Zabrak: +1 Might, -1 Will
Wookie: +1 Might, -2 Social
Twi'lek: +2 Social, -1 Will
Cathar: +1 Vitality, -1 Will
Trandoshan: +1 Vitality, -2 Social
Mirialan: +1 Perception, -1 Vitality
Echani: +1 Perception, -1 Will
Mon Calamari: +1 Will, -1 Perception
Ugnaught: +1 Might, -1 Perception
Togruta: +1 Will, -1 Might
Rodian: +1 Perception, -2 Social

## Attributes
SWLOR has 5 attributes.
* Might, a measure of how physically strong a character is
* Perception, a measure of the character's situational awareness
* Willpower, a measure of the character's strength of will
* Vitality, a measure of the character's physical toughness
* Diplomacy, a measure of the character's social grace

The first four attributes are all relevant to combat, and all 5 attributes affect various abilities and game events.  For your first character, it's probably a good idea to read the [Combat Guide](/Gameplay/combat-guide) to get a feel for which attributes you want to prioritise.

All attributes start at 8, plus racial modifiers (so e.g. a Human starts with 9 VIT and 7 PER).

You have the usual 30 points to spend on increasing your attributes, but increases are more expensive than in base NWN.
* +1 = 1 point
* +2 = 2 points (so 3 total)
* +3 = 3 points (so 6 total)
* +4-6 = 4 points (so 10-18 points total)
The highest you can raise any single attribute to on creation is 14 (before racial adjustments).  

For example you could be 14/10/10/10/10 to start with (before racial stats).

For your first character, it's recommended to take at least 12 Vitality.

(You will get the ability to raise your attributes further later in the game.  The highest 'hard' value you will be able to increase any of your attributes to in gameplay is 26). 

### Abilities and Hit points, Stamina points, and Force points
Characters have 40 HP plus 40 HP for each positive point of VIT modifier, plus equipment bonuses and temporary bonuses from abilities.  So VIT makes a significant difference to your overall HP pool.  VIT also improves the regen rate of HP when resting - 1 + VIT mod HP recovered per round.

Vitality also increases your max STM (stamina) and FP (force points). However, regeneration of STM during resting is influenced by PER, and regeneration of FP during resting is influences by WIL. In both cases, 1 + half your modifier per round. 

## Perks
Perks define your character's abilities.  There are two types of perk.
* Passive perks include things like weapon proficiencies, that allow you to equip different gear and use it more effectively.
* Active perks grant abilities that can be used in or out of combat.

One of the very first things you'll want to do when you roll up a new character is assign some or all of your 10 initial Perk points.  Hit C to access the character sheet and hit the Perks button to pull up the Perks window.
> If you can't see the Character or Perks window when you do this, you probably need to upgrade your version of NWN.  The ability to make custom windows was added in a patch during 2021.

You can sort Perks by category.  It's a good idea to give yourself proficiency in at least one type of weapon, tunics or breastplates and maybe some other armour types, the Med Kit ability under First Aid and, if you're a Force Sensitive character, the Force Push perk.  

Every time you gain a rank in a skill, you gain an additional perk point (up to a maximimum of 300 additional Perk points).  There are ways to reset perks in game later if you take something you later regret.
