<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>SWLOR offers players the ability to purchase and build, manage, and maintain their own properties throughout the game world. You're able to decorate these different properties as you see fit and gain the bonuses they provide.</p>
<p>This page is intended to give you general insight into how the system works. It's not intended to be all-inclusive - some things are better discovered on your own!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Property Types</h2>
<ul>
  <li><i><strong>Apartments </strong></i>- These are standalone units you can rent inside NPC cities, such as Veles Colony. Apartments require an upfront fee for purchase and have an ongoing lease fees which are charged at a daily rate. Leases may be paid up to 30 days in advance. If the apartment goes unpaid for longer than this period, it will be permanently lost and all structures and items inside will be destroyed.</li>
  <li><i><strong>Starships</strong></i> - These are mobile properties which can be used to engage in space gameplay. Up to ten starships may be registered under your name at NPC or PC starports. They can only be accessed if you are at the location in which they are docked.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><i><strong>Structures</strong></i> - “Structure” is a general term given to various objects. These can be tables, chairs, or entire buildings. They're able to be rotated and moved within the game world provided you have sufficient permissions.</li>
  <li><i><strong>Buildings</strong></i> - These are structures located within a city which can be entered by players who have permission. Most buildings are permanently “public” which means anyone may enter them. Other buildings are customizable and their public setting can be configured.</li>
  <li><i><strong>Cities</strong></i> - If a city hall is placed within a claimable area, a city will be formed. The person who placed the city hall will become the mayor of the city and be able to place additional buildings, adjust permissions, and participate in elections. See the “Cities” section for more detail.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Building Types</h2>
<ul>
  <li><i><strong>City Hall</strong></i> - This is the “brains” of a city and must always be the first building placed in order to start it. Inside city hall you will find two types of terminals: <i>Citizenship Terminals</i> and <i>City Management Terminals. </i>The Citizenship Terminals will allow you to view city details, such as tax rates and citizen count, and allow you to become a citizen. See the “Citizenship” section for more detail.</li>
  <li><i><strong>Bank</strong></i> - Banks are useful for providing item storage to your citizens. The number of items which can be stored starts at 20 and can be increased by purchasing upgrades for the city. At max upgrades, the item cap is 100 items.</li>
  <li><i><strong>Medical Center</strong></i> - Medical centers provide bonuses to reduce the penalties received when citizens die. The mayor must purchase upgrades to enact this benefit.</li>
  <li><i><strong>Starport</strong> </i>- Starports provide starship services for your citizens. This allows them to use quick transportation between major NPC planets. Once a starport has been placed, it will be shown in the list of landing destinations when a player accesses the dock point for the planet. Upgrades to this type of structure reduce ship repair prices.</li>
  <li><i><strong>Cantina</strong></i> - Social gathering spots for players. Upgrades to this type of structure increases the amount of Roleplay XP gained by players.</li>
  <li><i><strong>House</strong></i> - Homes which can be used as residences for your citizens. They offer item storage which can be increased by placing furniture within the property.</li>
</ul>
