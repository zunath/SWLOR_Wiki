<h1>Character Creation Basics</h1>
<p>(Stat Explanation, Basic Guide for how these builds were made - TBD)</p>
<p>Beyond the specific builds listed below, there are commonly agreed upon patterns that apply to most characters. &nbsp;As of 12/2/2022, these include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Crafting: Primary Stat 16 (+1 Racial), Secondary Stat 16, Vitality 13. &nbsp;Consult the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uzF7rtXXUaxBS_8cZb83M_9I2bMma6WBOFRkgDY5PP0/edit#gid=207006097">SWLOR Design Bible</a> to see what the primary attributes for your crafting are.</li>
  <li>Combat: Accuracy Stat 16, Damage Stat 16, Vitality 13. &nbsp;Your +1 racial can go into either of the top two. &nbsp;Consult the SWLOR Design Bible's <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uzF7rtXXUaxBS_8cZb83M_9I2bMma6WBOFRkgDY5PP0/edit#gid=1544368677">Equipment - Weapons</a> page to see which attributes you need to max, based on weapon type. &nbsp;Yes, this means deciding on what weapon category you want to use is the first and most important step before assigning attributes.<ul>
      <li>Example build: One Handed Vibroblade fighter builds with 16 Perception, 17 Might and 13 Vitality.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Force Sensitives always rely on Willpower to power their Force abilities. &nbsp;This typically causes a suboptimal build split, resolved in a variety of ways based on the Force Sensitive builds below. &nbsp;</p>
<p>No build should ever start with <u>less</u> than <strong>13</strong> Vitality. &nbsp;No build should ever end with anything <u>less </u>than <strong>18 </strong>Vitality. &nbsp;Learn from this writer's sins.</p>
<h2>Leveling Builds</h2>
<p>Every character will eventually unlock no more than 35 additional points to put into attributes. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>General consensus is to put 10 into your Primary/Accuracy stat and 10 into your Secondary/Damage stat.</li>
  <li>Standard builds should virtually always put 10 into Vitality and drop the remaining 5 into Social, so that you can use two Leadership Auras at once (see <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uzF7rtXXUaxBS_8cZb83M_9I2bMma6WBOFRkgDY5PP0/edit#gid=320772458">Leadership </a>in the SWLOR Design Bible for details).</li>
  <li>Force Sensitive builds typically put 10 into Vitality and 5 into Willpower for Guardian/lightsaber types or they put 5 into Vitality and 10 into Willpower for Consular/force power casting types.</li>
</ul>
<p>See below for specific examples of builds. &nbsp;The authors of specific builds may have different guidance from this general purpose section, which should be weighed based on their rationale and your individual goals for your character.</p>
<h1>STANDARD / MUNDANE Builds</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><a href="https://wiki.starwarsnwn.com/en/Gameplay/Builds/basic-ranged-vibro">Basic Ranged/Finesse Vibroblade</a></h5>
<p>This is intended to provide a basic template for any sort of character utilizing Blaster Pistols, Rifles or Finesse Vibroblades. The basic gameplay loop will consist of buffing yourself and allies through the very strong abilities in the Devices and First Aid trees, and then utilizing your weapon or utility abilities during combat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>FORCE SENSITIVE Builds</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><a href="https://wiki.starwarsnwn.com/en/Gameplay/Builds/Force-Tank">The Force Tank</a></h5>
<p>A simple build with strong defenses against physical attacks, capable of dealing sustained damage in melee while surviving focused fire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.starwarsnwn.com/Gameplay/Builds/Force-Melee-Tank">Force Melee (Tank Variant)</a></p>
<p>A straightforward Force Sensitive melee build. This one focused on not soaking and dodging hits.</p>
