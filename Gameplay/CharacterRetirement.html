<p>Every character has a start and an end to their story. The start is self explanatory, with you arriving on CZ-220 at the start of your character's career on this server. The end is more nebulous. It may be a final climactic moment, or a slow fade away into the background as time and interest for them fade away. It may be something you opted for yourself, or it may be something that the DM team decided was appropriate for your character given their circumstances.</p>
<p>Character Retirement Packages are intended to ensure that players see permadeath/character retirement as a result of in-character circumstances, and not as an out-of-character punishment. Intended to avoid stagnation and to promote players joining the server with fresh concepts without worrying overmuch about the early game grind.</p>
<h6>Character Retirement</h6>
<p>Any character retired is a final decision. A retired character cannot be brought back without approval from the DM team. This is true whether or not the DM team was the one to enforce the retirement. This is true whether it was a death or simply your PC leaving, and its unlikely to be approved without very good reason. The purpose of character retirement is to avoid stagnation, and resurfacing old characters is contrary to that.</p>
<p>When you want to retire a character, feel free to open a ticket requesting they be retired. You will be asked to provide a screenshot of your in-game character sheet (the NUI window, not the login screen one), and asked generally what you want out of it.</p>
<p>It is also required that the PC you are retiring have been around for a minimum of three months, be established in RP, and be above level 250. The final decision on if a character is able to provide these bonuses on retirement rests with the DM team.</p>
<h6>Base Perks</h6>
<p>The basic perks of character retirement is receiving 250 SP on a new PC. This avoids the majority of the grind to 350 without removing the need to visit multiple planets entirely.</p>
<p>You also can start pursuing Masteries right away associated with any skill you have level 50 in. Further, your first 3 masteries take only 1 week to master. These quick masteries do not stack with perks from any future ranks you may later achieve in a faction, such as Jedi Padawan or Knight.</p>
<p>Finally, you receive 100,000 credits.</p>
<h6>Option 1: Gear, XP Boost</h6>
<p>Your first option, in addition to the Base Perks, is to receive the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>25% Bonus XP</li>
  <li>An additional 150k credits (250k total).</li>
  <li>One piece of custom loot from the DMs.<ul>
      <li>Loot will be t5 gear, with slight bonuses beyond what is normally craftable. Or it will be some other appropriate item based on what the DM handling your request feels inspired to create. Dual wielding can result in 2 items being made.</li>
      <li>Loot can normally be upgraded to t5.5 gear by supplying a Lightsaber Upgrade Kit to the DM. They will let you know whether or not this is an option.</li>
      <li>A lightsaber is allowed if appropriate. This will largely depend on your concept and if it is reasonable for you to have. Unaligned Force Users, or those who do not start off as a loyal member of the Jedi, Revanites or Sith Empire, will be unlikely to be approved for one.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h6>Option 2: Instant Masteries</h6>
<p>Your second option is to instantly start the game with two masteries already learned, and as usual 3 7 day mastery slots. Further, the DM team will be far more open to requests to learn special skills. Certain skills, like Psychometry, are still unlikely to be approved. Special skills tend only to be one per character.</p>
<h6>&nbsp;</h6>
<h6>Prelude</h6>
<p>Players are also encouraged to join each other in creating factions. The aforementioned 100k credits is primarily there not only so you can gear yourself up, but also so that you can afford the cost of establishing a player owned city.</p>
<p>While the DM team cannot guarantee that every prelude request will be fulfilled, as it depends on DM interest and time, we are very interested in running these in general to ensure the server has fresh content and characters for players to engage with.</p>
