<h1>General Crafting Guidance</h1>
<p>Information on specific crafts can be found in the links at the bottom. There are general principles that apply to all crafting though.</p>
<h2>Stats</h2>
<p>Each crafting skill has a primary and secondary attribute. &nbsp;As of 12/2/2022, they are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Smithery: Might/Vitality</li>
  <li>Engineering: Vitality/Agility</li>
  <li>Fabrication: Perception/Willpower</li>
  <li>Agriculture: Social/Willpower</li>
</ul>
<p>While important (particularly for Smithery and Engineering), these attributes affect the total CP your character has to craft with and don't otherwise affect quality or progress directly. Refer to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uzF7rtXXUaxBS_8cZb83M_9I2bMma6WBOFRkgDY5PP0/edit#gid=207006097">SWLOR Design Bible</a> for specifics, in the event these stats change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>High attributes are especially important for crafting high end gear with enhancements. &nbsp;This makes careful building mandatory for Smithery and Engineering. &nbsp;Fabrication only uses enhancements to increase the storage size per piece of furniture (and may affect city buildings somehow?) so peak Perception/Willpower isn't as critical. &nbsp;Likewise, Agriculture also doesn't make much use of Enhancements, assuming Fabricators/Cooks make good use of gear.</p>
<h2>Gear</h2>
<p>The SWLOR Design Bible has a particular page on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uzF7rtXXUaxBS_8cZb83M_9I2bMma6WBOFRkgDY5PP0/edit#gid=34641109">Equipment - Crafting</a> for crafters who want the best. &nbsp;If you're not a Smith, consult the Design Bible to find the best gear for you and commission a Smith to make it. &nbsp;In the meantime, do all the quests you can for your particular Craft Guildmaster to raise your Shop Level, since each Guildmaster sells non-enhanced dedicated crafting gear. &nbsp;That will still give you some advantage for crafting things if you wear it.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Guildmasters also sell perk tokens and progressively better bags.</li>
  <li>Depending on what you craft, you may be able to buy the item needed to complete a guild quest from a vendor. &nbsp;If you can, it's always better to do so since (A) credits are much easier to get than the materials for making it and (B) the reward for turning in the quest typically gives more credits than you'd spend buying the item in question.</li>
</ul>
<p>For top end crafting, build or commission a T4 or T5 weapon with two crafting enhancements on it (if you doublewield, commission two for even more bonus). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a specific step-by-step example of how a Smith can build their first crafting gear, take a look at <a href="/Gameplay/Crafting/epiphany-crafting-guide">Epiphany's Guide to Building Smithing Gear</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Crafting Values</h2>
<p>All crafting is driven by three values:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Control</strong>: This provides more quality with each use of Basic Touch. &nbsp;The most valuable stat, as quality improves the chances of applying enhancements/mods to gear you're crafting. &nbsp;Much less important if you aren't crafting something with enhancements (like Fabrication).</li>
  <li><strong>CP</strong>: This provides crafting stamina. &nbsp;Once you run out, you can only do Basic Synthesis.</li>
  <li><strong>Craftsmanship</strong>: This provides more progress per use of Basic Synthesis.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Crafting Perks</h2>
<p>Every crafter should take <strong>Waste Not</strong>, <strong>Maker's Mend</strong> and the <strong>Basic Touch</strong> perk. &nbsp;They're used per the Crafting Loop section below.</p>
<p>It is the collective agreement of every crafter interviewed that no other perk is worthwhile. &nbsp;Save your SP for the recipes. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Crafting Loop</h2>
<p>If you're making something without enhancements, your loop is this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Waste Not</p>
  <p>Basic Synthesis x 4</p>
  <p>Waste Not</p>
  <p>Basic &nbsp;Synthesis x4</p>
  <p>Master's Mend</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Repeat until your progress is done. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>The use of Waste Not reduces the loss of durability by 50% for the next four actions (at the cost of 4 CP).</li>
  <li>Each use of Basic Synthesis costs 0 CP but diminishes durability.</li>
  <li>Master's Mend offsets actual durability loss by 30 (at the cost of 10 CP).</li>
  <li>Increasing Craftsmanship will allow for more progress per use of Basic Synthesis but otherwise the effective limit to your crafting will be how much CP you have (derived from your Primary and Secondary Stat for that Crafting skill).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're making something with enhancements, your loop is this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Waste Not</p>
  <p>Basic Touch x 4</p>
  <p>Waste Not</p>
  <p>Basic &nbsp;Touch x4</p>
  <p>Master's Mend</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Repeat until you've maxed quality. &nbsp;Then do the first loop until you've completed progress.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Quality is only needed for enhancements and can be otherwise ignored (if you're doing Fabrication for example). &nbsp;Theoretically high quality may yield more experience per crafting attempt but the Dedication aura under the Leadership skill tree is better anyway as it applies to all things including outside of crafting. &nbsp;No one takes perks or raises quality on non-enhanced gear for the experience.</li>
  <li>If applying enhancements, always aim for 100%. &nbsp;Experienced crafters swear 95% really isn't 95%.</li>
  <li>High tier equipment can hold two enhancements. &nbsp;These can be of the same type (i.e. they can stack).</li>
  <li>Clearly, having very high Primary and Secondary stats is necessary to provide enough CP to power each round of Waste Not/Master's Mend usage, especially since Basic Touch costs 3 CP per use as well.</li>
</ul>
