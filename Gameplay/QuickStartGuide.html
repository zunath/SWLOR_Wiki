<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><span class="text-huge">Let's Get Started!</span></h3>
<p>Welcome to the Quick Start Guide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This guide is intended to be a quick introduction of mechanics and necessary information to get you started on your space odyssey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't forget to read <a href="https://forums.starwarsnwn.com/t/server-rules-and-dm-standards-new/1573">The Rules</a> before you get started.</p>
<p><i>This is a W.I.P, the information here is in the process of being peer-reviewed.</i></p>
<h1>Character Creation</h1>
<h2>Pick your Archetype&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Before you get started, you'll want to figure out what kind of character you want to play. Force Sensitivity, or your character's ability to access the Force is determined at character creation. Force Sensitivity is necessary for playing a lightsaber-wielding, force-magic using character, while Standard characters have access to a broader range of tech-skills, like Devices and First Aid, as well as Weapon Skills that Force Sensitives do not get. For more information regarding builds, you can read the <a href="https://wiki.starwarsnwn.com/en/Gameplay/Builds">Character Builds Guide</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(w.i.p)</p>
<h2>Playable Races</h2>
<p>Human, Zabrak, Mirialan, Togruta, Twi'lek, Ugnaught, Wookie, Echani, Rodian, Trandoshian, Mon Calamari, Bothans, Kel Dor, Chiss, Cathar.</p>
<p>In regards to playing an unlisted race:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"With all colors unlocked for customization, players <i>are</i> allowed to choose to have their character be a separate near-human or “hybrid” race, such as Pantorans, half-Twi’lek, and other similar races that can be easily represented in such a way. However, under no circumstances will any such races be granted any mechanical or roleplay capabilities above and beyond what the mechanically supported races possess." -DM Announcer</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Builds</h2>
<p>The SWLOR server boasts a totally unique class and progression system from any other NWN server. Check here for cookie cutter builds and write ups for information on how it all works.</p>

<p>(w.i.p)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Character Sheet</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The character sheet in SWLOR is different than what you will find in other NWN servers. By pressing C you will open a large black box which can be freely resized and moved around the screen. The top left of your character sheet will display your character's name, below which is your portrait, and below that is a button to change your portrait at any time.</p>
<p>To the right of your character name at the top is your Archetype (Force Sensitive or Standard), below which is your current and max Health Points in red, Force Points in blue, and Stamina in green. Below this is read out of your current accrued SP and AP gained out of the maximum of 350 and 35 respectively. Blow that is a readout of your current statistics in order of Might, Perception, Vitality, Willpower, Agility, and Social.</p>
<p>To the right of your Archetype is your character race (mechanically speaking, since there are many playable races not represented in character creation). Below that are a list of various passive statistics in this order:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A readout of your current Main Hand Damage&nbsp;</li>
  <li>A readout of your current Off Hand Damage.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Attack, (dictates the amount of damage dealt in addition to your weapon's physical damage and your weapon's primary damage stat.)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Accuracy (dictates your chances of landing attacks.)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Evasion (dictates how difficult you are to hit for enemies.)&nbsp;</li>

  <li>Control (dictates how much quality progress you make in crafting.)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Craftsmanship (dictates how much creation progress you make in crafting.)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Sav. Throws (Dictates your saving throws against skills and powers, from left to right they are Fortitude, Reflex, and Will).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the far right side of the character sheet is a list of buttons to take you to various other menus or pages. From top to bottom, they are&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Skills - (Lists all of your skills in the game and allows you to lock a skill from degrading, as well as allowing you to spend RPXP on skills and languages.)</li>
  <li>Perks - (Lists all of the perks in the game, allowing you to spend your SP on various perks to learn new abilities or gain access to various gear.)</li>

  <li>Settings - (Allows you to toggle whether you are notified of achievements, toggle holonet visibility, Turn on subdual mode to prevent killing other players when reducing them to 0 HP, toggle visibility of hourly reset reminders, toggle whether you gain Force XP from melee attacks with lightsabers and electroblades.)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>The Setting</h1>
<h2>Current Timeline</h2>
<p>SWLOR is set in the year 3956 BBY in the Legends timeline of the Star Wars universe, currently experiencing the events of KOTOR 1. The main community hub and planet for roleplay is Viscara, a small planet in the outer rim that was once home to some ancient Sith that are now nothing more than ruins and crumbling architecture. Viscara is also a Force Nexus, allowing for a high concentration of Force Sensitives gathering in one place.</p>
<p>(w.i.p)</p>
<h2>Factions</h2>
<p>There are several playable factions available on the server, not including player made factions, which can be made at whim.</p>
<p>NPC Factions: Factions ingrained into the setting that are driven by NPC leadership and DM's, as well as gaining access to fast track masteries.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.starwarsnwn.com/en/Lore/Factions/jedi-order">The Viscaran Jedi Order</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.starwarsnwn.com/en/Lore/Factions/revanites">The Viscaran Revanite Sith Enclave</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.starwarsnwn.com/en/Lore/Factions/the-republic">Republic Navy Fort Hope</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.starwarsnwn.com/en/Lore/Factions/the-mandalorians">The Mandalorians</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.starwarsnwn.com/en/Lore/Factions/hutt-cartel">The Hutt Cartel</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.starwarsnwn.com/en/Lore/Factions/czerka-corporation">Czerka Company</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.starwarsnwn.com/en/Lore/Factions/malakites">Malak's Sith Empire</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Player Factions: Factions that are more player driven with less NPC and DM guidance or propulsion and no mastery fast tracks.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Smuggler</li>
  <li>Redmoon Hall</li>
  <li>Blue Diamond</li>
  <li>Jal Shey</li>
  <li>Worker's Respite Township</li>
  <li>Cadence</li>
  <li>Celestial Phantom</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span class="text-big">Joining A Faction</span></h3>
<p>All you have to do is approach a member of either faction in character, either through tracking them down In Game, or through the Holonet. Your character can start with a pre-existing history with the chosen faction, so long as it is as the lowest rank (i.e Jedi Initiate/Sith Aspirant/Republic Private). You can pursue in character to ascend the ranks and grow towards higher ranks.</p>
<p>Some factions, such as Jedi, Sith, and Mandalorians, acquire DM items at certain ranks. For Jedi/Sith these would take the form of Lightsabers, something your character will make when they are taken as a Padawan. For Mandalorians they receive Beskar with their promotion to Verd, instead. Beskar is a unique lightsaber-resistant armor that is incredibly durable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Sith/Jedi should log their training for the DMs to track their progress. To do so, open a ticket via the discord and post a short blurb explaining what your character learned/trained and with who. Written short-stories on the forums about your character training/practicing will also be considered.</p>
<p>Attaining the rank of Jedi Knight or Sith Inquisitor will take some time, so be sure to enjoy and invest plenty of your energy into the training and learning of your character as they work towards it. Lightsabers are treasured items in Star Wars, so be prepared to dedicate time toward being an initiate and working toward your lightsaber. But don't worry, your Jedi/Sith peers can make you a training foil that in the mean-time that will still signify your affiliation with a Force Order.</p>
<h1>Quick Start Tutorial:</h1>
<p>Upon entering the game your character will find themself in a shuttle heading to CZ-220, the landing point for star ships entering the planet Viscara. Here, you can edit your character's appearance by pressing C or opening the Character sheet, and then clicking “Appearance”. From the Settings button in the window, you can also adjust your character's height. Please be responsible with designing your character's look. Tomfoolery will be addressed by the DMs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Talk to the Twi'lek at the back of the ship to proceed into the tutorial zone, CZ-220.</p>
<h2>CZ-220, Selenes Request</h2>
<p><i>If you have done Selene's quest once on your player handle, you won't need to do it again to leave the zone, though the credits may be valuable early on.</i></p>
<p>The front desk operator of CZ-220, Selene, asks you do 3 tasks for her around the station. There are more than three people you can help, so choose the three you wish to help from this list:<br>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>The item fabrication droid.</li>
  <li>Security man.</li>
  <li>Refining man.</li>
  <li>C3-po Crafting bot.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each NPC has it's own quest to give you. You only need to do the first quest for each to satisfy Selena's quest. Once the quest is complete, the shuttle to Veles will be available.&nbsp;</p>
