<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><span class="text-huge">Let's Get Started!</span></h3>
<p>Welcome to the Quick Start Guide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This guide is intended to be a quick introduction of mechanics and necessary information to get you started on your space odyssey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't forget to read <a href="https://forums.starwarsnwn.com/t/server-rules-and-dm-standards-new/1573">The Rules</a> before you get started.</p>
<p><i><strong>This is a W.I.P, the information here is in the process of being peer-reviewed.</strong></i></p>
<h1>Character Creation</h1>
<h2>Pick your Archetype&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Before you get started, you'll want to figure out what kind of character you want to play. Force Sensitivity, or your character's ability to access the Force is determined at character creation. Force Sensitivity is necessary for playing a lightsaber-wielding, force-magic using character, while Standard characters have access to a broader range of tech-skills, like Devices and First Aid, as well as Weapon Skills that Force Sensitives do not get. For more information regarding builds, you can read the <a href="https://wiki.starwarsnwn.com/en/Gameplay/Builds">Character Builds Guide</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Playable Races</h2>
<p>Below is a list of mechanically implemented races. All races are mechanically identical with the exception that non-humans learn their respective language automatically and Droids cannot be Force Sensitive. There are non-mechanically implemented races which will be listed below.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Human</li>
  <li>Bothan</li>
  <li>Chiss</li>
  <li>Zabrak</li>
  <li>Wookie</li>
  <li>Twi'lek</li>
  <li>Cathar</li>
  <li>Trandoshan</li>
  <li>Mirialan</li>
  <li>Echani</li>
  <li>Mon Calamari</li>
  <li>Ugnaught</li>
  <li>Togruta</li>
  <li>Rodian</li>
  <li>Kel Dor</li>
  <li>Droid</li>
  <li>Nautolan</li>
</ul>
<p>In regards to playing an unlisted race:</p>
<p>Any near-humans that can reasonably exist can be made with the human race mechanically and have colors and such changed to represent them better in-game. There are also a number of blindfolds and head coverings for Miraluka.</p>
<p>Below is a list of non “near-human” races with heads available by modifying helmets:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Arcona</li>
  <li>Chadra-Fan</li>
  <li>Devaronian</li>
  <li>Gamorrean</li>
  <li>Kaleesh</li>
  <li>Karkarodon</li>
  <li>Tuskan</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"With all colors unlocked for customization, players <i>are</i> allowed to choose to have their character be a separate near-human or “hybrid” race, such as Pantorans, half-Twi’lek, and other similar races that can be easily represented in such a way. However, under no circumstances will any such races be granted any mechanical or roleplay capabilities above and beyond what the mechanically supported races possess." -DM Announcer</p>

<h2>Builds</h2>
<p>The SWLOR server boasts a totally unique class and progression system from any other NWN server. Check here for cookie cutter builds and write ups for information on how it all works.</p>

<h1>The Setting</h1>
<h2>Current Timeline</h2>
<p>SWLOR is set in the year 3956 BBY in the Legends timeline of the Star Wars universe, currently experiencing the events of KOTOR 1. The main community hub and planet for roleplay is Viscara, a small planet in the outer rim that was once home to some ancient Sith that are now nothing more than ruins and crumbling architecture. Viscara is also a Force Nexus, allowing for a high concentration of Force Sensitives gathering in one place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Factions</h2>
<p>There are several playable factions available on the server.</p>
<p>NPC Factions: Factions ingrained into the setting that are driven by NPC leadership and DM's, as well as gaining access to fast track masteries.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.starwarsnwn.com/en/Lore/Factions/jedi-order">The Viscaran Jedi Order</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.starwarsnwn.com/en/Lore/Factions/revanites">The Viscaran Revanite Sith Enclave</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.starwarsnwn.com/en/Lore/Factions/the-republic">Republic Navy Fort Hope</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.starwarsnwn.com/en/Lore/Factions/the-mandalorians">The Mandalorians</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.starwarsnwn.com/en/Lore/Factions/hutt-cartel">The Hutt Cartel</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.starwarsnwn.com/en/Lore/Factions/czerka-corporation">Czerka Company</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.starwarsnwn.com/en/Lore/Factions/malakites">Malak's Sith Empire</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Player Factions: Factions that are more player driven with less NPC and DM guidance or propulsion and no mastery fast tracks.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Smuggler</li>
  <li>Redmoon Hall</li>
  <li>Blue Diamond</li>
  <li>Jal Shey</li>
  <li>Worker's Respite Township</li>
  <li>Gimpassa</li>
  <li>Cadence</li>
  <li>Celestial Phantom</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span class="text-big">Joining A Faction</span></h3>
<p>All you have to do is approach a member of either faction in character, either through tracking them down In Game, or through the Holonet. Your character can start with a pre-existing history with the chosen faction, so long as it is as the lowest rank (i.e Jedi Initiate/Sith Aspirant/Republic Private). You can pursue in character to ascend the ranks and grow towards higher ranks.</p>
<p>Some factions, such as Jedi, Sith, and Mandalorians, acquire DM items at certain ranks. For Jedi/Sith these would take the form of Lightsabers, something your character will make when they are taken as a Padawan. For Mandalorians they receive Beskar with their promotion to Verd, instead. Beskar is a unique lightsaber-resistant armor that is incredibly durable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Sith/Jedi should log their training for the DMs to track their progress. To do so, open a ticket via the discord and post a short blurb explaining what your character learned/trained and with who. Written short-stories on the forums about your character training/practicing will also be considered.</p>
<p>Attaining the rank of Jedi Knight or Sith Inquisitor will take some time, so be sure to enjoy and invest plenty of your energy into the training and learning of your character as they work towards it. Lightsabers are treasured items in Star Wars, so be prepared to dedicate time toward being an initiate and working toward your lightsaber. But don't worry, your Jedi/Sith peers can make you a training foil that in the mean-time that will still signify your affiliation with a Force Order.</p>
<h1>Quick Start Tutorial:</h1>
<p>Upon entering the game your character will find themself in a shuttle heading to CZ-220, the landing point for star ships entering the planet Viscara. Here, you can edit your character's appearance by pressing C or opening the Character sheet, and then clicking “Appearance”. From the Settings button in the window, you can also adjust your character's height. Please be responsible with designing your character's look. Tomfoolery will be addressed by the DMs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Talk to the Twi'lek at the back of the ship to proceed into the tutorial zone, CZ-220.</p>
<h2>Welcome to SWLOR!</h2>
<p>After making your character you will spawn into the welcome area! There are various NPCs around who will talk to you about various mechanics present in the game, such as the pilot speaking about learning Piloting or the bounty hunter speaking about how engineers make droids. Others will speak on factions, like the Force sensitive civillian who speaks of the Jedi and Revanite Sith.</p>
<p>Make sure to stop at Sal Vulcano's shop (the Gamorrean on the left as you exit) to get some basic clothes and a helmet so you can set up your signature look before setting foot onto the server proper, and don't forget to save it to your outfits slots!</p>
<p>To change your outfits open the character sheet with C and click Appearance on the right.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/wiki_appearance.png"></figure>
<ol>
  <li>Appearance Tab - This allows you to customize your skin color, hair color, eye color, tattoo color, and body parts separate from your clothing.</li>
  <li>Equipment Tab - This allows you to customize your armor, helmet, cloak, main hand weapon, and off hand weapon appearances.</li>
  <li>Settings Tab - This includes the ability to toggle visibility of your helmet, cloak, and to increase or decrease your height.</li>
  <li>Color Target - This changes what is being colored accordingly, such as hair, skin or tattoo on Appearance, or Leather 1, Leather 2, Cloth 1, Cloth 2, Metal 1, and Metal 2 on Equipment.</li>
  <li>Part Target- This changes what part of your body you are changing, such as your head, hands, torso, and so on.</li>
  <li>Color Picker - This is where you select the color to be applied to your color target.</li>
  <li>Part Picker - This is where you pick the model to be applied to your part.</li>
  <li>Part Cycler - For quickly moving to the next model in the Part Picker list without having to scroll and click.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="/wiki_equipment_tab.png"></figure>
<p>In the equipment tab you can select the drop down bar highlighted on the left to access the list of modifiable equipment. This will only apply to equipment currently equipped to your character. On the right is the Outfits tab, where you can store an save up to 25 outfits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you've spoken to all the NPCs that interest you and set up your new outfit, speak to Captain S'luuk to be sent to CZ-220, the tutorial area of SWLOR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>CZ-220 and Selan's Request</h2>
<p>After landing you will arrive in the hangar. Once you've spoken to the NPCs you wish to interact with here head straight ahead into the main section of CZ-220.</p>
<p>As soon as you enter you will be greeted by Selan Flembek, the NPC with your first quest! Speak to her and accept her quest to continue.</p>
<p><i>Note: If you have done Selan's quest once on your player handle, you won't need to do it again to leave the zone, though the credits may be valuable early on.</i></p>
<p>She will ask you to aid 3 of the NPCs around the space station:<br>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Halron Linth - He will ask you to kill enemies in the lower levels. First mynocks, then droids, and finally a mini boss experiment creature.</li>
  <li>Avix Tatham - He will ask you to gather ore, then ask you to refine it.</li>
  <li>Crafting Terminal Droid Operator - They will task you with gathering items from crates and scrap piles and then with crafting, crafting a bedroll, or crafting a knife.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each NPC has it's own quest to give you. You only need to do the first quest for each to satisfy Selena's quest. Once the quest is complete, the shuttle to Veles will be available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other notable NPCs in this area include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Darryn Beto, by the Crafting Droid; who will sell you all of your starting gear and provide you with all the things you need to survive.</li>
  <li>Dario Breto, by the front desk; who will sell Training Weapons. These are much weaker versions of their respective weapons, but require no perks to equip. Good for roleplay and for disguises!</li>
  <li>Cheriss Ordo, just past the desk and Dario in the bar; who has a datapad you can retrieve from the experiment room and return to her for a reward.</li>
  <li>Frank, in the cooking pots area; Will sell you roleplay prop items like cigars, cigarettes, cups, and goblets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you've completed the requests and spoken to Selan to get your ticket, it's time to head to Viscara and enter the open world of SWLOR! Don't worry, you can come back to CZ any time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Veles City Highlights</h2>
<p>There is much to do in Veles, the main city of Viscara, owned and operated by Czerka Corporation. But there are some key quests you may wish to do. Be warned, some of these should not be addressed immediately unless you have help, so feel free to level up a bit or ask around for someone to help you with these (particularly the mandalorian facility).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Taxi Terminal Repairs - Given by Dessta Bocktorb, a blue twi'lek directly to your right after you exit the Starport. This will unlock the taxi system and let you get around Veles much easier.</li>
  <li>Kath Hound Part Collection - Given by Szaan Synko just in front of the Starport, by the central square.</li>
  <li>Kath Hound Hunting - Given by Moira Halaz, just outside of the central square headed south, towards the exit to Veles.</li>
  <li>Weapons for Krystalle - Given by Krystalle in the far north-eastern area, in the refugee section in a back alleyway.</li>
  <li>Package for Denam Reyholm - Given by Roy Moss in the same alley as Krystalle, unlocks the ability to respec your character. This quest will take you into the mountains which is a bit harder, so make sure you can handle the area first.</li>
  <li>Locate the Mandalorian Facility - Given by Tal'gar Meyne by the market terminals directly north of the central square, this quest chain unlocks a fairly important spot to grind for lower levels before leaving the planet. That being said, you should wait until you are struggling to grind from the rest of the planet to go here, and may still wish to bring a friend.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After completing some of these quests and their follow ups you should check in with Irene Colstaad, north of the market terminal (just in front of Czerka tower), and Harry Mason, whom can be found right next to Roy Moss.&nbsp;</p>
