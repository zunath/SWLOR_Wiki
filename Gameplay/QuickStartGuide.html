<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><span class="text-huge">Let's Get Started!</span></h3>
<p>Welcome to the Quick Start Guide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This guide is intended to be a quick introduction of mechanics and necessary information to get you started on your space odyssey.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>This is a W.I.P, the information here is in the process of being peer-reviewed.</i></p>
<h1>Character Creation</h1>
<h2>Pick your Archetype&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Before you get started, you'll want to figure out what kind of character you want to play. Force Sensitivity, or your character's ability to access the Force is determined at character creation. Force Sensitivity is necessary for playing a lightsaber-wielding, force-magic using character, and while Standard characters have access to a broader range of tech-skills, like Devices and First Aid, and cool Blaster abilities. For more information regarding builds, you can read the <a href="https://wiki.starwarsnwn.com/en/Gameplay/Builds">Character Builds Guide</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span class="text-big">Jedi and Sith</span></h3>
<p>Let's face it, you came here because you really want to be a cool Jedi and/or misunderstood Sith Lord. Here's how it works:</p>
<p>All you have to do is approach a member of either faction in character, either through tracking them down In Game, or through the Holonet. Your character can start with a pre-existing history with the Sith/Jedi so long as it is as the lowest rank (i.e initiate). You can pursue in character to ascend the ranks and grow toward building their own lightsaber. Lightsabers are distributed by the DMs at their discretion.</p>
<p>Sith/Jedi should log their training for the DMs to track their progress. To do so, open a ticket via the discord and post a short blurb explaining what your character learned/trained and with who. Written short-stories on the forums about your character training/practicing will also be considered.</p>
<p>Do not expect to be a Jedi Master or Sith Lord in a week. Lightsabers are treasured items in Star Wars, so be prepared to dedicate time toward being an initiate and working toward your lightsaber. But don't worry, your Jedi/Sith peers can make you a training foil that looks just like a lightsaber and is just as mechanically viable.</p>

<h2>Builds</h2>
<p>The SWLOR server boasts a totally unique class and progression system from any other NWN server. Check here for cookie cutter builds and write ups for information on how it all works.</p>

<h1>Quick Start Tutorial:</h1>
<p>Upon entering the game your character will find themself in a shuttle heading to CZ-220, the landing point for star ships entering the planet Viscara. Here, you can edit your character's appearance by pressing C or opening the Character sheet, and then clicking “Appearance”. From the Settings button in the window, you can also adjust your character's height. Please be responsible with designing your character's look. Tomfoolery will be addressed by the DMs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Talk to the Twi'lek at the back of the ship to proceed into the tutorial zone, CZ-220.</p>
<h2>CZ-220, Selenes Request</h2>
<p><i>If you have done Selene's quest once on your player handle, you won't need to do it again to leave the zone.</i></p>
<p>The front desk operator of CZ-220, Selene, asks you do 3 tasks for her around the station. The three people you need to assist are:<br>The item fabrication droid.</p>
<p>Security man.</p>
<p>Refining man.</p>
<p>Each NPC has it's own quest to give you. You only need to do the first quest for each to satisfy Selena's quest. Once the quest is complete, the shuttle to Veles will be available.&nbsp;</p>
