# Helmet Overview

Helmets are heavy armor that occupies the head slot. Helmets offer high defense and HP compared to their Cap counterparts, but at the expense of less diversity and lower stamina and FP as well as lower regen of respective pools. A character, especially a Standard (someone without Force sensitivity), in heavy armor may wish to invest into Agility to counteract the loss of stamina and stamina regen or mix and match heavy and light armor.  
  
Heavy armor (excluding general armors) double your casting time for all Force abilities.
