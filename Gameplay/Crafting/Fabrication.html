<h1>Fabrication Overview</h1>
<p>Fabrication is one of four crafting skills in SWLOR. Fabrication is used to craft buildings for player cities and furniture to furnish ships, apartments, and buildings in the aforementioned player cities. Furniture modified by enhancements acquired from Engineers can also be used in Fabrication to increase storage space in the structures you place the furniture in. The primary stat for Fabrication is Perception and the secondary stat is Willpower.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fabrication requires an investment of 70 Skill Points to purchase every skill within the tree, though most people would recommend only purchasing the agriculture actions Basic Touch, Master's Mend, and Waste Not, &nbsp;bringing the total required for all recipes and must-have actions down to 63 SP.</p>

<h2>Housing Decoration Tips</h2>
<p>“Put each wall on your hot bar. Now, using the lines on the floor, select one spot on the floor. Use the hot bar button for each wall, click the same pixel or follow the same line on the floor to guide your next placement. Try to move your mouse away from your guideline as little as possible. Next, go into placeables menu and label each wall, wall 1, wall 2, wall 3,etc. this is so you don’t lose track. Then, adjust orientation so the walls are all facing the right way. Finally, use the movement buttons to move the walls incrementally so they are apart. You’ll find this way they’re connected neatly and with seamless lines so long as your patient.” - Tinfy</p>
