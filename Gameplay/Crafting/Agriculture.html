<h1>Agriculture Overview</h1>
<p>Agriculture is one of four crafting skills in SWLOR. Agriculture is used to craft food for players and pets that grant various powerful buffs. The primary stat for Agriculture is Social and the secondary stat is Willpower.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Agriculture requires an investment of 50 Skill Points to purchase every skill within the tree, though most people would recommend only purchasing the agriculture actions Basic Touch, Master's Mend, and Waste Not, &nbsp;bringing the total required for all recipes and must-have actions down to 43 SP.</p>
