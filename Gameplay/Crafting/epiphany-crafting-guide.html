<h1>Epiphany's Guide to Crafting Gear</h1>
<p>If you're a Smith and you don't have any Smithing Gear already, my recommendation is that you aim at a set of Dream gear (that's the T4). Those materials are usually pretty 'easy' to gather (compared to the T5) and you can usually afford a couple of tries per piece of gear for the two enhancements to successfully applpy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>With armor, you have 9 pieces with 2 slots of enhancements = 18 opportunities for enhancement. People's preference varies but between 10-14 of those should go to Improved Cotton IV which raises Control (which raises Quality), and all the rest should go to Improved Chaugaine IV to raise Craftsmanship. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, craft a crafting weapon. If you double wield, even better since you can make two of them. Go for T4, add in one Improved Flexsteel IV for Control and one Improved Neutronium IV for Craftsmanship. That bumps you to 20 or 22 slots of enhancements. Jain uses a spear so I only get one but if you have a high combat skill in something doublewieldable, it'll be even easier for you.</p>
<p>My very specific personal loop which works for me 90% of the time on T5 with two enhancements is:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Waste Not</p>
  <p>Basic Touch x4</p>
  <p>Waste Not</p>
  <p>Basic Touch x4</p>
  <p>Masters' Mend</p>
  <p>Waste Not</p>
  <p>Basic Touch x4</p>
  <p>Basic Synthesis x4</p>
  <p>Masters' Mend</p>
  <p>Basic Synthesis until victory or bust!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're finding it too hard to put two enhancements on when trying to make T4 crafting gear, make T3 or T2 gear using exactly the same steps above, and put it on and use that to make T4.</p>
<p>Once you have a good set of T4 with every slot filled with two enhancements, assuming you have good Might and Vitality, you should be able to start blowing away T5 with 2 enhancements! &nbsp;Enjoy.</p>
