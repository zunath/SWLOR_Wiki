<h3>Snippets Overview</h3>
<p>Snippets are pieces of logic which are executed based on a conversation's script parameters. There are two different types of scripts: 'appears' and 'action' which go on a conversation node's 'Text Appears When' and 'Actions Taken' script events respectively. These scripts MUST be set, otherwise snippets will not function correctly.</p>
<p>Once the scripts are set, you can add as many snippets as you like as parameter values. The name of the parameter must match the snippet name and the value must match the expected arguments. Refer to the tables below for what to put into these.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a configured snippet on the 'Appears When' event.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a configured snippet on the 'Actions Taken' event.</p>

<h3>Snippet Condition List</h3>
<p>These commands will show or a hide a node based on the outcome of the snippet. For example, if you use condition-has-quest and the player does NOT have that quest, the node will be hidden.</p>
