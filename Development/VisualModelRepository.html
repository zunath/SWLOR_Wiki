<h1>SWLOR Weapon Visual Model Guide</h1>
<p>Located below is a selection of links which display various appearance options for selected weapons. While this generally has little effect in game, it is meant to be a tool used during a collaborative effort between a player and a Dungeon Master to assist with appearance modifications for customized weapons. It is important that if a player is provided with a customized weapon, that they do not change the appearance of the weapon further while in game. Doing so could break the appearance of the weapon.</p>
