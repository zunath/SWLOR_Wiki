<h3>Target Audience</h3>
<p>This guide is targeted towards developers and contributors who want to create new playable races.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will not cover the intricacies of ripping models, modifying them, or creating them from scratch. You will need to refer to other guides on Google for help on that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>External Resources</h3>
<p>One of the most difficult parts of creating a new race is putting the models and textures together. Again, this is outside the scope of this guide but you can find more information at the links below. If you get stuck, reach out in our <a href="https://discord.gg/MyQAM6m">Discord </a>for assistance.</p>

  <li><a href="https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Portrait">Portrait Information for NWN</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A working <a href="https://wiki.starwarsnwn.com/en/Development/Environment-SetUp">development environment</a></li>
  <li>Completed models for the race. These must be dynamic (i.e armor will display on them). There must be at least three heads for male and at least three heads for female.</li>
  <li>An icon for use during character creation to signify the race.</li>
  <li>Portrait textures for both male and female&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Add the Content</h3>
<p>Your models, textures, and any other files need to go into their respective folders within our Hakpak content repository. Refer to the development environment guide above for more detail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Integrating the Parts Into Code</h3>
<p>A new class must be added to the <code>Feature/AppearanceDefinition/RacialAppearance/</code> folder. By default, Human parts are used for the new race. The following example overrides all of the parts but you don't need to do so - it just depends on what race you're doing.</p>
<p><code>namespace SWLOR.Game.Server.Feature.AppearanceDefinition.RacialAppearance</code></p>
<p><code>{</code></p>
<p><code>&nbsp; &nbsp;public class MonCalamariRacialAppearanceDefinition: RacialAppearanceBaseDefinition</code></p>
<p><code>&nbsp; &nbsp;{</code></p>
<p><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;public override int[] MaleHeads { get; } = { 6, 44, 48, 49, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 112, 113, 114, 117, 119, 120, 127 };</code></p>
<p><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;public override int[] FemaleHeads { get; } = { 3, 6, 16, 17, 21, 26, 29, 41, 43, 47, 109, 110, 115, 119, 122 };</code></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;public override int[] Torsos { get; } = { 204 };</code></p>
<p><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;public override int[] Pelvis { get; } = { 204 };</code></p>
<p><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;public override int[] RightBicep { get; } = { 204 };</code></p>
<p><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;public override int[] RightForearm { get; } = { 204 };</code></p>
<p><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;public override int[] RightHand { get; } = { 204 };</code></p>
<p><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;public override int[] RightThigh { get; } = { 204 };</code></p>
<p><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;public override int[] RightShin { get; } = { 204 };</code></p>
<p><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;public override int[] LeftBicep { get; } = { 204 };</code></p>
<p><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;public override int[] LeftForearm { get; } = { 204 };</code></p>
<p><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;public override int[] LeftHand { get; } = { 204 };</code></p>
<p><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;public override int[] LeftThigh { get; } = { 204 };</code></p>
<p><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;public override int[] LeftShin { get; } = { 204 };</code></p>
<p><code>&nbsp; &nbsp;}</code></p>
<p><code>}</code></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
