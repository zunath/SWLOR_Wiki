<h1>DM Items</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the dynamic universe of SWLOR (Star Wars Legends of the Old Republic), players can request custom items from a Dungeon Master (DM) or Quest Master (QM). These bespoke pieces, personalized to each character, often rank among the game's most powerful assets. Notably, top-tier weapons and armor, termed as 'Tier 5.5 items', are examples of such powerful, custom creations.</p>
<p>Beyond weaponry and armor, the range of custom items also extends to 'flavor items' that enhance narrative depth and non-equipable spell-casting items. These unique items can imitate mundane powers and offer valuable character buffs, adding an extra layer to gameplay.</p>
<p>These custom items, brought to life by DMs or QMs, intertwine the players' creativity with their character's narrative arc. They serve as powerful in-game tools and symbols of each character's unique journey in the SWLOR universe.</p>
<h2>Request Process</h2>
<h3>Ticket</h3>
<p>The process of applying for a custom DM can be done at anytime, though it is at the DM's discretion to grant such an item. Items can be applied for on the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/484936923341651971/930228689000603708">#Ticket</a> channel of the SWLOR Discord.&nbsp;<br><br>When submitting a request, please add the following information to your ticket in this format:</p>
<p><br><strong>Item Name:</strong><br><strong>Type:</strong><br><strong>Enhancements:</strong><br><strong>Description:</strong><br><br>At the end of the request, take some time to explain any additional background information about the item, and how or where your character would have come across the item.</p>
<h3>Response Time</h3>
<p>The SWLOR Team is a small, but dedicated team. It often takes time to get to each ticket as there are multiple coming in per hour.</p>
<h2>Enhancements</h2>
<p>When selecting an enhancement for an equipable item, two can be selected from the table below. The same enhancement can be taken twice to get a stronger, single enhancement - Accuracy +10, for example.<br>&nbsp;</p>
