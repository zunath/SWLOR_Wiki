<h1 style="text-align:center;">Dungeon Master's Guide</h1>
<p>If the players are the lifeblood and backbone of SWLOR, then the Dungeon Masters and Quest Masters and the heart and nerves that keep everything connected and keep everything flowing smoothly. It's a demanding role, but it can also be a very rewarding one that prevents stagnation within the server. It's a voluntary role, one that should not be considered work, but one that should be considered a privilege.</p>
<p>The efforts of the DM and QM team push player agenda in the right direction, meditate disputes, and guide the improvement of server mechanics in a direction that is conducive to a relaxing (and sometimes exciting) role-playing experience.&nbsp;</p>
