<h1>Dungeon Master Client Basics</h1>
<p>The DM Client for SWLOR is a versatile and powerful tool used for running events and overseeing player interaction. Because this tool has a very similar layout to the player client, it allows new quest masters to adjust to the tool very quickly.</p>
<p>Below is an example of how the DM Client looks in-game:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New users should note several things:</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1131457115236610120/1161011068252991549/DM_Client_Hud_Raw.png?ex=6536bed1&amp;is=652449d1&amp;hm=9d89b61e7a02cc0b8028cec038297e04167a23b6cfeaade76bf9fffe15a7504d&amp;"></figure>
<p><br>1. All players and DM Client users are visible in the party screen - this acts as a quick reference player menu which allows DMs/QMs to find online players quickly. Recent connections are generally shown at the bottom of the scrollable list.</p>
<p>2. All player comms are shown in the left-most chat window. If a player uses SWLOR's version of party chat (comms), it will show up here for all DM Client users to see. This allows DMs to keep up with an event party event while they are in a different cell or out of normal volume range. Tells are not displayed to DMs, as they are considered private and only a server administrator can access these for review.</p>
<p>3. Chooser - This button opens the Chooser Menu.</p>
<p>4. Creator - This button opens the Creator Menu.</p>
<p>5. Show Triggers - This button is largely useless on SWLOR due to mechanical overhaul.</p>
<p>6. Appear/Disappear - This button allows a DM/QM to hide or reveal themselves to players for any number of reasons. Depending on whether or not the user is hidden or visible, the button will change accordingly.</p>
<p>7. Pause - This button has been disabled on SWLOR.</p>
<p>8. Difficulty Slider - This tool has been disabled on SWLOR.</p>
<h2>Radial Menus</h2>
<p>Most interactions with Player Characters and Non-Player Characters on SWLOR is done through Radial Menus, much like on other Neverwinter Nights Servers:</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:34.54%;"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1131457115236610120/1161017717210493048/Radial.png?ex=6536c502&amp;is=65245002&amp;hm=788fc93f1c2b9bf784a5d4562ea04c8514912c7a1ad84d6ef8e2e21f0a7386e2&amp;"></figure>
<p>Using the number pad, users can quickly navigate these menus. Buttons on the radial menu correspond to similar placements on the number pad</p>
<p><u>Limbo</u> - Allows the selected entity to be placed in Limbo. Limbo is an unseen folder where NPCs can be placed when they are unneeded and need to be deleted. They can be recovered by finding the Limbo folder in the Chooser Menu. PCs cannot be sent to Limbo when selecting the Limbo option.</p>
<p><u>Go To</u> - Allows the user to quickly jump to a PC or NPC when accessed from the radial menu. While this is less useful while the PC in question is in the user's immediate view, the radial menu can also be accessed by right clicking on the PC's portrait in the party sidebar mentioned above.</p>
<p><u>Heal</u> - Heals the PC/NPC to full health and removes buffs/debuffs. Will also revive a downed PC as long as they don't respawn. Revive does not work on NPCs who have already been defeated.</p>
<p><u>Take Control</u> - Allows users to take control of NPCs. Does not work on PCs. Note that there are three options below:<br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="table">
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <figure class="image"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1131457115236610120/1161021662351872101/Radial_Take_Control.png?ex=6536c8af&amp;is=652453af&amp;hm=bc33ffb1370a95ba263c5361872d37b4e137fc8a4575e7cf83df36fb2302c647&amp;"></figure>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p><u>Take Control</u> - Only allows the user to have access to the same powers that the NPC would have access to. Note that this doesn't work as intended on SWLOR.</p>
          <p><br><u>Toggle AI</u> - Turns on/off NPC AI if they have not engaged in combat with another PC/NPC. Unreliable, but sometimes useful.</p>
          <p><br><u>Take Control Full Powers</u> - Allows user to take control of the NPC with <i>Most</i> DM Client powers available to you. User can jump to players, use widgets and wands, etc.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
