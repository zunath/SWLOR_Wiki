<h1>Dungeon Master Client Basics</h1>
<p>The DM Client for SWLOR is a versatile and powerful tool used for running events and overseeing player interaction. Because this tool has a very similar layout to the player client, it allows new quest masters to adjust to the tool very quickly.</p>
<p>Below is an example of how the DM Client looks in-game:</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:75.9%;"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1131457115236610120/1161007907446472774/image.png?ex=6536bbdf&amp;is=652446df&amp;hm=b82938c7e70c44428597d2ddf6e62f62c3479c729eae2ecdee03b2763f06acbc&amp;"></figure>
<p>New users should note several things:</p>
<p><br>1. All players and DM Client users are visible in the party screen - this acts as a quick reference player menu which allows DMs/QMs to find online players quickly. Recent connections are generally shown at the bottom of the scrollable list.</p>
<p>2. All player comms are shown in the left-most chatbar. If a player uses SWLOR's version of party chat, it will show up here for all DM Client users to see. This allows DMs to keep up with an event party event while they are in a different cell or out of normal volume range. Tells are not displayed to DMs, as they are considered private and only a server administrator can access these for review.</p>
<p>3. Chooser - This button opens the Chooser Menu.</p>
<p>4. Creator - This button opens the Creator Menu.</p>
<p>5. Show Triggers - This button is largely useless on SWLOR due to mechanical overhaul.</p>
<p>6. Appear/Disappear - This button allows a DM/QM to hide or reveal themselves to players for any number of reasons. Depending on whether or not the user is hidden or visible, the button will change accordingly.</p>
<p>7. Pause - This button has been disabled on SWLOR.</p>
<p>8. Difficulty Slider - This tool has been disabled on SWLOR.</p>
