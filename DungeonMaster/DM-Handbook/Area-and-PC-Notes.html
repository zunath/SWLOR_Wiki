<h1>Area and PC Notes</h1>
<h2>Area Notes</h2>

<p>The area notes is a simple tool that can be used to keep track of information as it pertains to individual gameplay areas while using the DM Client. The top, DM only notes section allows a user to input information and strings of text that can only be seen by DM Client users.</p>
<p>The input field just below that allows a DM Client user to change information about the area that is displayed in the combat log or the console which is displayed to players upon entering the cell whether it be by a manual DM teleport, or through an area transition that has been preplaced.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>PC Notes</h2>
<p>The PC notes feature is a useful tool that is seldom used within the DM Client. This tool allows individual users of the DM Client to input certain notes and texts into a character's character sheet that can only be accessed by users with sufficient permissions to use the DM Client.</p>

<p>When accessing a character sheet from a non-DM Client character, the rightmost tab titled notes contains the above depicted screen. From this screen, a user can generate new notes, change notes, and delete notes. These notes can contain substantial amounts of information and are saved with each individual DM Client user information between the title and the body text blocks. This allows various characters to have multiple entries from multiple DM Client users and allows other DM Client users to see what notes have been made and by whom.</p>
