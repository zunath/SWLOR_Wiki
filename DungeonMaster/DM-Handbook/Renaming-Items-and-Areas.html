<h1>Renaming Items and Areas</h1>
<p>Renaming items and areas is a useful storytelling tool that can be used to further immersion within the world of SWLOR and there are two methods to accomplish this: the <code>/rename</code> command and the DMFI Renaming Wand.</p>
<p>Utilizing the <code>/rename</code> command will allow the user to target an object, NPC, or open ground and open an NUI window depicted below:</p>

<p>If the ground is targeted as is depicted in the image above, the area will be renamed. This will be reflected in the Chooser Menu and if a character is in the renamed area, the location tooltip when hovering over their portrait on the party menu.</p>
<p>Additionally, NPC and item descriptions can be changed with the naming wand. A dialogue box will open when an NPC or item is targeted after using the wand, prompting the name or description change:<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Simply follow the instructions on the dialogue box to complete the name/description change.</p>
<p>For items located in your inventory, the standard <code>/itemdesc</code> command will also change the item's description. Note that there appears to be an approximate 350 character limit to these descriptions.</p>
