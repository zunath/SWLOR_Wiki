<h1>Chooser Menu</h1>
<p>The chooser menu in SWLOR functions identically to base Neverwinter Nights. It has several buttons which correspond to the radial menu, but has the added feature of being able to select a specific creature first - whether that be a single left click in the environment, or via the -creatures list as depicted below.</p>
