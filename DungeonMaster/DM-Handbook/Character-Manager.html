<h1>Character Manager</h1>
<p>The character manager is a tool that allows users more customization and flexibility than previous possible on most other Neverwinter Nights servers. This tool allows users to save, load, edit, and utilize previously made characters with a quick and intuitive dialog window as depicted below:</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1131457115236610120/1161411989239763015/image.png?ex=65383434&amp;is=6525bf34&amp;hm=6ef306f41d8fc75851eb6f9bc920e8669f61bdcc0595c05d0db10b3dc1ed6823&amp;"></figure>
<p>This window has several features that can be access upon using the <code>/cm</code> command, though the most notable features include:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Search - Allows a user to search for a previously saved NPC. This function will search for <i>all </i>NPCs that are saved using this tool, not just their own. If any DM or QM saves an NPC, it is accessible to all users on the DM Client.</p>
<p>2. Add New Creature - Allows a user to save any NPC. Once this button is clicked on, the cursor will change and allow the user to pick an NPC in the game world to save. They will be saved under the NPC's currently assigned name and will retain the exact inventory; outfit appearance - helmet, weapons, and armor, stats; and faction assignment ex. Merchant, Hostile, and Commoner. <i>Do not</i> add PCs to this manager. Doing so will cause irreparable damage to the PC and the PC will need a full remake.</p>
<p>3. Create - Allows a user to spawn the corresponding NPC anywhere where there is a walkable space in the game world. Unlike the Creator Menu, however, users cannot hold down shift to create multiples. The create button must be pressed every time a new creature is copied into the world.</p>
<p>4. Delete - Allows a user to delete unneeded NPCs. There is no way to restore deleted NPCs. If it's not yours, don't touch it.</p>
<p>It should be noted that if a user wants to save an updated copy of the NPC, the saved must be deleted in the Character Manager and the updated NPC saved in its place.<br>&nbsp;</p>
