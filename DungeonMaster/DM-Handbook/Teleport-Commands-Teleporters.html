<h1>Teleport Commands and Teleport Objects</h1>
<h2>Teleport Objects</h2>
<p>Teleport objects are placeable objects that can be placed in the game world by a user to allow quick transition from one teleport object to another. These transitions can be placed within the same area, or in different areas across the server. Upon clicking on this teleport object, the user is instantly teleported via area transition to the corresponding destination.</p>
<p>Teleport objects can be located in the Creator Menu under Placeable Objects &gt; Custom &gt; Special 5.</p>
<h2>Teleport Commands</h2>
<p>Teleport Commands allow a user to quickly generate area transitions between one teleport object and another. The following teleport commands are available on the server:</p>
<p><code>/tptag</code> -</p>
<p><code>/tpdest</code> -</p>
<p><code>/tpwp</code> -</p>
