<h1>Teleport Commands and Teleport Objects</h1>
<h2>Teleport Objects</h2>
<p>Teleport objects are placeable objects that can be placed in the game world by a user to allow quick transition from one teleport object to another. These transitions can be placed within the same area, or in different areas across the server. Upon clicking on this teleport object, the user is instantly teleported via area transition to the corresponding destination.</p>
<p>Teleport objects can be located in the Creator Menu under Placeable Objects &gt; Custom &gt; Special 5.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When placed, the teleport object will appear transparent and become highlighted once the mouse cursor hovers over it. From here, the teleport object can be renamed and different destinations and tags can be added with teleport commands.</p>
<h2>Teleport Commands</h2>
<p>Teleport Commands allow a user to quickly generate area transitions between one teleport object and another. The following teleport commands are available on the server:</p>
<p><code>/tptag</code> - Allows a user to change a teleport object tag.</p>
<p><code>/tpdest</code> - Allows a user to change a teleport object destination.</p>
<p><code>/tpwp</code> - Allows a user to teleport to a transition tag. Note that this only works for pre-placed transition tags included within the base module. User created tags and teleport objects cannot be accessed with this command.</p>
<h4>Example:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="table">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Teleport Object 1:</th>
        <th>Teleport Object 2:</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>/tptag tptp1</td>
        <td>/tptag tptp2</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>/tpdest tptp2</td>
        <td>/tpdest tptp1</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</figure>
<p>In the example above, Teleport Object 1 uses the tag tptp1 while Teleport Object 2 uses tptp2. Then, Teleport Object 1 uses destination tptp2 while Teleport Object 2 uses destination tptp1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything revolves around the initial tag for each teleporter. This essentially tells each teleporter who it is. The destination tag simply tells the teleporter that it's assigned to where the character who clicks on it is going to be sent to. Tags can be set to whatever the user desires, but it's easiest to maintain a singular word that is unique to the specific user, followed by numbers. In this case, tptp[number].&nbsp;</p>
