<h1>Creator Menu</h1>
<p>The Creator Menu is used to spawn items, NPCs, and placeables in SWLOR. The use of the creator menu is fairly simple and this page will mainly discuss placeables and their usage.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1131457115236610120/1161111826495442955/image.png?ex=65371ca7&amp;is=6524a7a7&amp;hm=1064718f071f6353f68ff0a8f172c5caa99755163110c42656a5a5a7e5bd2cc5&amp;"></figure>
<p>Creatures otherwise referred to as NPCs can be placed in the world by selecting the relevant creature by clicking on the name of the desired creature after navigating the various creature categories. When a creature's name is highlighted, press the create button and the mouse icon will change. From there click on any walkable area within the world to spawn the NPC. Note that users can hold shift to place multiple items, creatures, and placeables. Use caution as too many NPCs will cause a server crash or severe slowdown. Players with lower end hardware will suffer performance drops.</p>
<h2>Placeables</h2>
<p>Placeables are unique scenery items that can be used to create more interesting and unique areas for DM/QM events, and to assist in storytelling. Placeables are added to the world in the same way that NPCs are, however placeables cannot be selected or moved once placed by normal means. Two techniques are available to assist with easier placeable usage:</p>
<ol>
  <li>DM Wand</li>
</ol>

<p>Using the DMFI Wand's numerous features can be daunting at first, but the most important feature for easily using placeables can be accessed within the DM Wand. To begin using this tool, activate it on the toolbar at the bottom of the screen or use it from the inventory. Once it's activated, it'll open a conversation dialogue with the following screen:<br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1131457115236610120/1161114054165790830/image.png?ex=65371eba&amp;is=6524a9ba&amp;hm=788a782316d722efe525a401641528740c0a1f05296dfab85d2af0ff5a94c626&amp;"></figure>
<p>From here, select option <i>5. Object: Work with an object.&nbsp;</i></p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1131457115236610120/1161114493632401448/image.png?ex=65371f23&amp;is=6524aa23&amp;hm=6441cb14c38c31a3f39d803a955c0d6ab02f25081dd8d6e5fccd05fb67ed9a61&amp;"></figure>
<p>Once selected, the above dialogue will be displayed. From here, users can use the listed options to assist with proper placement orientation. This can be useful for larger objects, or if an object needs to have a specific, perfect compass orientation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The ‘Y’ Method</p>
<p>The ‘Y’ Method is simple and revolves around short trial and error when placing objects. Simply hover the cursor over a placeable object that needs to be edited and press the ‘y’ key on the keyboard. This will play a short destruction sound and delete the item that was previously placed. From here, a user can replace the object at a different orientation for a more desired placement. Note that placeable spawn orientation depends on placement from the user's DM Client character, and not the map's preset compass direction. Moving the DM Client character will assist in providing more desirable results when using placeables.</p>
<p>Note that some objects cannot be deleted with The ‘Y’ Method. In this case, the DM Wand or the Destory Object Widget should be used to remove the placeable. Use caution when activating the Destroy Object Widget, as it will have a deletion range of a few meters and is capable of deleting several objects, creatures, and items in one click - it will also destroy triggers, sound nodes, and waypoints on occasion.&nbsp;</p>
