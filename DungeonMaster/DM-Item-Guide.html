<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This guide is intended to help Dungeon Masters build unique items for players. The goal is to provide special rewards to players which are not overpowered and balance well with the rest of the game.</p>
<p>The SWLOR Bible should be referenced when deciding how powerful an item should be. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uzF7rtXXUaxBS_8cZb83M_9I2bMma6WBOFRkgDY5PP0/edit#gid=207006097">The document can be found at this link</a>.</p>

<h2>Item Rules</h2>
<h3>1. The tier of the item must be respected</h3>
<p>The “Equipment” tabs of the design bible should be referenced to determine baseline stats for an item. The tier should always be considered. For example, a tier 1 pistol should not have the DMG rating of a tier 5 pistol. This makes the item unbalanced compared to other items within the same tier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Item properties should be restricted by existing mechanics</h3>
<p>Currently, a maximum of TWO enhancements can be applied to crafted items. For lower tiers of items, this can be zero or one.</p>
<p>This same restriction should apply to all DM-built items. Refer to the available enhancements on the bible for a list of what item properties you can add on top of the baseline item.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Stats should be relative to existing items</h3>
<p>There is a very clear progression of DMG, Defense, and other stats on all items. The status quo must be maintained to ensure a balanced game. When making an item, ensure the stats are within 1-2 points of other equivalent items within the same class and tier.</p>
<p>For example, you should never go over 26 DMG on a longsword because the highest tier longsword normally available sits at 24 DMG. Please note that these numbers are BEFORE enhancements are applied. You can, of course raise the DMG from 26 to 32 to represent attaching two +3 DMG enhancements to the item. But no other enhancements can be applied beyond that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Be Conservative</h3>
<p>If you're not sure what's balanced - be conservative and go for the lower number. It's far easier to offer more powerful items than it is to nerf existing ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5. Ask for Help</h3>
<p>Reach out to the rest of the DM team if you need help deciding what to put on an item. You can also make a copy of the design bible and use the damage calculation sheet to give an estimate of how powerful an item will be.</p>
